Present world society doesn't only maintain itself by force. It also needs to present itself as natural. This does not mean that we are always told "Present conditions can't be changed" in so many words. On the contrary, it means that all the conflicting forces which have interests in the old world have to make us think that all that matters, insofar as how we live, can be reduced to mere ways of survival under existing conditions.

**All** the poor would like not to have to pay for things, not to have to **sell** any power over the possible free construction of the world, merely in order to survive. All workers forced to do shitty jobs like mining would like not to have to work down the mines, would like to have a world where the use of technology would actually be able to abolish the need for hard work and at the same time increase people's enjoyment of life. All the poor, somewhere in them, would like to live in a world where community and passion become the roots of who they are, how they relate to each other and what they do, what they produce, how they live.

A lot of the poor are struggling against the further imposition of poverty which the crisis of profitability has made a necessity for the enemy. But the enemy's lies, which are as yet always present in all struggles and will be as long as we don't achieve total victory (because there is no **mass** revolutionary consciousness without **mass** revolutionary struggle), only very rarely limit themselves to saying: "Accept the existing world, i.e. the enemy's power, or else die."

Whole fractions of the enemy base their lies on what they say about the poor, about the working class. For example, that what we really need is a change in the bosses' policies, Or a change in the law, or a change in how the State is run or "fair and decent" practices by the enemy, which forgets, of course, that our enemy is our **enemy**.

The fact that many working class people are **resisting** attacks on them doesn't mean that we're struggling to see our rulers act "fairly". In the heat of struggle, none of us really believe that. We know it's us fighting for **our** interests against the enemy fighting for **their** interests.

Morality and "rights" don't come into it. Resistance, like all struggle, is a matter of our **interests**, what we need, what we want. And whenever this goes beyond individualism and respect for the law, such as in riots and violent strikes, something else appears: working class people come closer together, experience the beginnings of community, in the real war.

Then, in come another lot of liars. Seeing their own career prospects and, also, what the poor have been doing, they present a spectacle denouncing "evil" policies of the State (which explicitly means defending the existence of the State), or start saying that our class violence was "forced" on us, or even "invented" by the police, and in any case should be abolished by means of different enemy policies.

But working class people who have been actively involved in struggles (and here I don't mean such passive "involvement" as sitting at home watching the telly whilst letting the "militants" get on with it, which is what many "striking" miners did) **all** know that in the war against the enemy there are both **offensives** and **defensives**, both short-term tactical aims and the broader fight as a whole.

Still, many who have been the most militant in struggles get taken in by the "militant" language of those whose role is to "represent" our struggles, anger and insolence. Everybody knows there is a difference between the actual practice of organising confrontation with the police, and being a shop steward whose essential function is to calm things down and, when it comes to the crunch, defend the unions and the system which needs them: the system of exploitation and wage-labour. But many who **have** confronted the police still look to the unions which isn't going to get them anywhere.

The weight of the enemy's lies doesn't only include the Sun, Channel 4, The Times, etc. Or statements by Thatcher that combative working class people are "mindless". It also includes, on a political level, the left and the far left, whose role is to try to get us to forget the real war and to further their own bureaucratic positions, either in the unions, the State, or in the dissident and moralist-humanist stratum which makes money out of "blaming" "unfair" enemy policies. Cf. "State of Siege". Ask a Trotskyist about Nicaragua and you'll see their line on the necessity to suppress strikes when it's in the national interest, which is what Thatcher says. Ask them about coordinated working class violence, and they'll tell you that it can be stopped if the rulers nationalise our exploitation. Ask an anarchist about the mines, and they'll either say: form a **real** union to manage them, or else: Manage them yourselves and sell the coal. But who wants to **work** down them? The leftists?

Read what dissidents have written about working class people imprisoned during the miners' strike. They say that it really is unfair, that the answer is to "protest" and to campaign for democracy, rights and justice. Bullshit! Those interested in **escalating** the struggle **all** know that those who organised terrorism against the scabs were right to do so; many ex-strikers would like to give McGahey the chop too, although not yet Scargill. They know that it's war, that the working class militants imprisoned should be freed because they're on our side, not because it would be "fair". Angry working class people shouldn't want to merely co-exist with the enemy for ever, until we die; neither should we see our aims as anything but the total military and social overthrow of the enemy and its system of wage-labour and property, with all its defenders, unions, States, in the East, the West, and the 3rd World.

In the short-term, it is vital that the fraction of the working class which looks forward to confrontations with the enemy, which takes pleasure in trying to push them as far as they will go, organises **channels of communication**, to publicise, discuss and practically develop its perspectives. This means not getting conned into such traps as wanting to organise protests and petitions, or supporting the left of capitalism or anyone else who speaks "in our name", who are all part of the defence of wage-labour.

This means not forgetting the war is total. And it's not only negative. It's positive too. What **can** be achieved is a world without money, exploitation, property. Where, on a world scale, "world society" means the active transformation of the world according to our needs and desires.

This, insofar as what we can organise now, doesn't mean ditching politics. On the contrary, it means politicising our struggle further. The Barcelona dockers, who organise a mass revolutionary coordination which openly opposes the unions (and calls for the abolition of wage-labour and for the self-emancipation of the working class) put out a call for the total blacking of **all** ships entering Britain during the miners' strike. Sadly they only put this call out a few weeks before the strike ended. If it had been successful, the strike would have become openly **political**. In more general terms, the political side of the **theory** which we need to take up and develop is a **part** of the generalisation and coordination of the struggle. It is whatever general understanding of our tasks, enemies, history and of the development of the enemy's society, benefits our struggle.

To think that theory is only for "intellectuals" is to give ground to the enemy, of which academics, for example, are a part. Combative working class people have nothing to lose but their chains, and those who don't fight can't win, but the revolution won't win without knowing it's up against, which is not a **policy** but a **society**.

Down with rights!

Down with dissidents!

Down with the state!

Down with daily pseudo-life!

For channels of working class communication today...

... for the armed destruction of the old world tomorrow!

All power to mass working class assemblies!

Power! Power!
