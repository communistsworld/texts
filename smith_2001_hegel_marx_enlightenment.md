title: "Hegel, Marx and the Enlightenment"
author: Smith, Cyril
date: 2001
description: Smith elaborates on the humanist conception of Marxism, and it's historical background over Hegel, the enlightenment movement and the medieval scholastics. This text is based on the [MIA version](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-cyril/works/articles/interim.htm), which reminds the reader that some of the ideas "remain half-baked".
...

1. Marx's work centres on the notion of true humanity as
   freely-associated in collective, mutual and individual
   self-creation. That is the content of his critique of political
   economy, which exposes the inhuman, unfree forms in which humanity
   has encased itself and thus shows how the proletariat -- in Marx's
   all-sided conception of that word -- can find the path to universal
   human emancipation.

2. This critique penetrates the false conception of 'single individuals
   in civil society', which was the advance/retreat of the
   eighteenth-century Enlightenment. It was an advance, because its
   conception of the individual free from state and church control
   opened the way for huge scientific, political and social changes. But
   it was also a retreat, whose effects are felt to this day, because it
   put a stop to all attempts to think about ourselves as a part of a
   unified self-changing world.

3. It was this Enlightenment conception which underlay the idea of
   nearly all varieties of socialism. The socialists wanted to overcome
   the lunacy of modern society by rationally rearranging the
   social-economic connections between 'citizens'. Each of these single
   individuals was left untouched until his or her 'circumstances' were
   altered. So the work of rearrangement had to be carried out by
   somebody else, an educated elite or party, which has somehow managed
   to escaped the power of the old order to mould individual
   consciousness. 'Theory' and 'doctrine', enterprises which stand apart
   from their subject-matter, are the business of an elite of this sort,
   which aims to enlighten the ignorant masses on the virtues of some
   prefabricated scheme. Marx himself, far from being an advocate of any
   activity like this, engages in the critique of all such plans, which,
   whatever their intentions, themselves express the class divisions of
   the existing social order.[^1]

4. Let us look briefly at some of the main characteristics of the
   Enlightenment way of thinking, the thought of the seventeenth and
   eighteenth centuries, when modern bourgeois society was taking
   shape. This is more or less what Hegel calls 'the Understanding',
   \[*Verstand*, as opposed to *Vernunft* = Reason\]. It sees the world
   from the point of view of one of these social atoms. The natural
   world and society looked like collections of discrete bits and
   pieces, machines made up of smaller machines. When the 'single
   individual' thought about this mechanical world, he could only think
   of himself as yet another machine, quite unchanged by interaction
   with the rest. In trying to think about these assemblies of atoms,
   many problems arose, but these could be answered if you broke each of
   them into separate sub-problems.

5. The individual got his knowledge of the world by logically decoding
   messages conveyed to him through his senses. Apart from these
   bulletins, the knowing subject and the object of knowledge were
   utterly different and separate from each other, as were Nature and
   humanity. Freedom, which for this outlook means the removal of
   'external' restrictions on the individual, did not exist in nature,
   where movement was rigidly determined. To be 'objective' you had to
   expunge everything subjective, like feeling, will or free creative
   activity. This was how reason, the equipment of each individual
   human, worked in opposition to superstition of all kinds, which
   churchmen and monarchs instilled into the heads of the masses. The
   Enlightenment's defeat of 'superstition' was an advance, without
   doubt, but one for which we paid a price: it walled us off from many
   centuries of thought about humanity and its world, for this had
   almost entirely been couched in religious terms.

6. This outlook made possible modern natural science, which seeks
   'objectivity' by separating its subject-matter from everything human,
   that is, by separating itself from its object. But what did that
   allow it to say about human society? Homo sapiens, like all
   biological forms, was part of this blind rushing about, and whether
   humans were put here by an absent Deity, or got here by chance, their
   social relations could only be understood as given externally to
   subjectivity. Political economy, and later sociology, studied social
   machines, made up of atoms driven by self-interest. However, since
   Reason was eternal -- eternally in battle against superstition --
   thought itself could not have a history: either a proposition was
   eternally true or it had always been false. The social order and its
   movement were governed by laws as fixed as the ones that ruled the
   solar system. By the end of the eighteenth century, Rousseau and Kant
   had begun to illuminate the weaknesses and contradictions underlying
   this Enlightenment project. What was the rational justification for
   Reason? If humans are 'radically evil' (Kant), democracy is not for
   them, but for angels. Humans will have to be 'forced to be free' by
   the Enlighteners (Rousseau).

7. Marx spent his entire working life as a pupil and critic of Hegel[^2]
   The significance of this dual relationship was lost, along with
   Marx's humanism, in the Enlightened, scientifically rational
   'Marxism' of the Second International. The Third International never
   recovered it, and in general continued the Enlightenment tradition,
   despite Lenin's heroic effort to read Hegel's 'Science of Logic' in
   1914-5.

8. Hegel must be taken as a whole. In particular, his Berlin years are
   crucial for what we need from him, including his work (a) on the
   State (1821); (b) on the history of philosophy; (c) on Aesthetics;
   \(d) on the philosophy of religion; (e) on the philosophy of
   history.[^3]

9. Each part of Hegel's programme, while preserving many of the advances
   of the Enlightenment, stands in opposition to its basic
   conceptions. In particular, where the philosophers either discarded
   religion or attempted to rationalise it, theology is central to all
   of Hegel's work. After his grappling with Christianity in his student
   years, his turn to philosophy \['science' = *Wissenschaft*\] is
   inseparable from his peculiar views on God. Even when the 'Marxists'
   did bring themselves to peep into Hegel, they just couldn't handle
   this aspect. Lenin's panic every time Hegel mentions God is
   comical. For Lukacs, who knew a great deal about Hegel, his religious
   views are a shameful secret.

10. When Hegel frequently professes his Lutheran convictions, this is
	not, as some Young Hegelians supposed, just an attempt to stay
	within the bounds of respectability and keep his job. But what kind
	of Lutheran is Hegel? Here are some peculiarities: (a) Hegel does
	not conceive of the Christian Trinity as belonging to particular
	events in history: the Creator does his work all the time. The Book
	of Genesis must be taken together with the Prologue to John's
	Gospel. The Son of God is not merely to be identified with the
	historical Jesus of Nazareth. (b) God creates the world and humanity
	within it because he has to, not out of free choice. He needs his
	creation: without it 'God is not God' and without our consciousness
	God is not self-conscious. (c) Hegel agrees that the Trinity is a
	mystery, and identifies his own 'speculative philosophy' as
	'mysticism'. But this does not imply that its truth is hidden: on
	the contrary, God reveals himself through it, and Hegel sees his own
	system as the self-thinking Idea which is at the same time the
	self-consciousness of God.[^4] So when Hegel says: 'The world is
	something produced by God, and so the divine idea always forms the
	foundation of what the world as a whole is' (*Lectures on the
	Philosophy of Religion*), he is a million miles away from the
	orthodox Christian understanding of God the Creator.

11. It is important not to overlook the depth to which Hegel's system is
	penetrated by this particular view of religion. For example, look
	again at the triadic divisions which abound throughout the system:

	> Logic, Nature, Mind;\
	> Universal, Particular, Individual;\
	> Being, Essence, Concept;\
	> Abstract Right, Morality, Ethical Life;\
	> Family, Civil Society, State.

	Each element of each triad is itself a triad. But each of these is
	an expression of the Holy Trinity: Father, Son, Holy Spirit, and the
	relationships between the members of each triad cannot be properly
	appreciated unless this is grasped. At every level, Hegel is showing
	how these three 'Persons' actively create and determine each
	other. Hegel sees God creating and being created by humanity.[^5]

12. Hegel turns both the Enlightenment conception of Reason and its
	religious opposite inside-out. Hegel's Reason is identified with
	divine wisdom. It does not merely exist passively in human history,
	but expresses itself as 'purposive activity' in the course of that
	history. 'In our knowledge, we aim for the insight that whatever was
	intended by the Eternal Wisdom has come to fulfilment -- as in the
	realm of nature, so in the realm of spirit that is active and actual
	in the world.' (*Reason in History*, p 19.) Spirit is the activity
	of humanity. But the consciousness of an individual human ('finite
	spirit') is no more than a fragment of the whole story, which is
	only found in the Self-consciousness of Spirit, an alias for the
	Self-consciousness of God. (By the way, Hegel has no use for the
	immortality of an individual soul, 'finite spirit'. Only the
	Infinite, the World Spirit, is eternal.)

13. A major problem arises in many religions: if God created and
	maintains a world which contains evil, was he then the creator of
	evil? But then what chance do we have of making the world a decent
	place to live? The Catholic Church in particular fought for
	centuries against any kind of dualist answer to this conundrum. It
	objected to any idea that the world is a product of both Good and
	Evil, 'matter' being the evil part. Hegel faces this problem in a
	manner which entirely separates him from orthodoxy.[^6] For Hegel,
	Evil is a part of God's creation. Indeed, the contradiction between
	Good and Evil is the driving force of all movement and development,
	and without it, there is no humanity. Thus Hegel's account of the
	Fall tears Genesis apart.

14. In this approach, Hegel closely follows another professed Lutheran,
	born two centuries earlier: the mystic shoemaker Jakob Boehme
	(1585-1696). Boehme is crucial, not just for Hegel's religious
	ideas, but for his entire philosophical work. For example, Hegel,
	who devotes about 30 pages of his *Lectures on the History of
	Philosophy* to Boehme, quotes him as saying:

	Nothing can be revealed to itself without opposition: For if there
	is nothing that opposes it, then it always goes out of itself and
	never returns to itself again. If it does not return into itself, as
	into that from which it originated, then it knows nothing of its
	origin. Boehme, 'The Way to Christ'. Hegel, 'Lectures on the History
	of Philosophy', Volume 3, p 203.)

	Hegel is also well aware that Boehme stands in a long line of
	mystical monks, Catholics whose ideas were condemned by the
	Church. Although Hegel only studied one or two of these in depth,
	they all contain ideas which are echoed in his work.

	- Eriugena (= 'born in Ireland'), also known as John the Scot
	  (810-877), believed that God does not create the world in one go,
	  but eternally; everything finite is contained within his infinite
	  nature and returns to it.
	- Joachim of Fiore (1135-1202) was a Calabrian abbot. His account of
	  the unity of truth and ignorance and his conception of Divine
	  Knowledge anticipated Hegel in many ways. Joachim believes that
	  God is knowing. His identification of the structure of the Trinity
	  with three stages of divine history formed the basis for centuries
	  of social struggles. The third of these stages, identified with
	  the Holy Spirit, was about to begin at any time, when the ending
	  of the corruption of the Church would usher in a thousand-year
	  Utopia.
	- The German monk Meister Eckhart (1260-1327) was the first to
	  develop the terminology of philosophy in German, translating and
	  adapting Latin terms. For him, God becomes conscious of himself
	  only within his creation. Eckhart also argues that Divine
	  Knowledge is 'the negation of negation'. As with other mystics,
	  Eckhart's aim was the unification of the soul with God. Christ is
	  continually born within each believing soul. Using a passage
	  passed on to him by the mystic von Baader, Hegel quotes Eckhart:

	  > The eye with which God sees me is the eye with which I see Him;\
	  > my eye and His eye are the same...\ If He did not exist, nor
	  > would I;\ if I did not exist, nor would He.[^7]

	- Nicolas of Cusa (1401-1464) argued that God was united with his
	  creation, so that the universe, including the human being, must be
	  infinite and divine. This 'coincidence of opposites' opened the
	  way for Copernicus (1473-1543), who cautiously published his
	  rather scaled-down version of this idea only on his death-bed.
	- Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), the Nolan, was not at all cautious,
	  openly taking Nicolas's ideas much further. He was arrested by the
	  Inquisition and burnt after several years of torture.[^8] Hegel
	  celebrates Bruno in several places. He praises him for asserting
	  (i) 'the unity of life and the unity of the World-Soul'; and (ii)
	  'the indwelling presence of Reason'.

	Bruno, who asserts the final cause to be immediately operative, and
	the life immanent in the universe, asserts it also to be existent as
	substance; he is therefore opposed to the conception of a merely
	extramundane understanding.

	And Hegel quotes Bruno as saying

	> To recognise the unity of form and matter in all things, is what
	> reason is striving to attain to. But in order to penetrate to this
	> unity, in order to investigate all the secrets of Nature. We must
	> search into the opposed and contradictory extremes of things, the
	> maximum and the minimum.

15. Many of Boehme's notions, often expressed with great obscurity, were
	linked with the Jewish mystical tradition called the Cabbalah, as
	well as with the Islamic movement, Sufism. All three, Christian,
	Jewish and Islamic heresies, maintained a centuries-long
	collaboration and dispute. (All this needs a lot of study, as well
	as the related movements within Buddhism.) Gnosticism and
	Neo-Platonism are also explicitly connected with Hegel's discussions
	of these topics. However, he combines approval of many of these
	ideas with critical re-appraisal.

16. But Boehme is also a link between Hegel and another, closely related
	set of ideas and activities.[^9] Through his idiosyncratic mystical
	terminology, Boehme connects with the Hermetic tradition via
	Paracelsus (1493-1541) and Bruno, both of whom were represented in
	Hegel's library, as was the magician Henry Cornelius Agrippa
	(1486-1535).[^10] Towards the end of the fifteenth century,
	translation of Greek authors, preserved until then only by Islamic
	scholars, opened up new ways of thought. The writings attributed to
	Hermes Trismegistus were widely studied as a body of work whose
	roots are extremely ancient. Together with Cabbalah, they had for
	centuries formed the basis for alchemy, astrology and natural magic,
	but now, and for the next three centuries or more, they were the
	background to the thinking of the leading figures in European
	thought in the run-up to modernity. It was this intellectual world
	that actually saw the birth of modern science.

17. As a scientific picture of the world, many of the results obtained
	by the alchemists and magicians look somewhat bizarre today. But the
	undoubted triumphs of the new scientific rationalism can blind us to
	what is important in the world outlook of the Hermetists. First of
	all, they saw that the contrasts and oppositions between the divine
	and the human, and between spirit and nature, were not
	unbridgeable. The cosmos was a whole, united by a series of internal
	relations, correspondences and 'sympathies' between its parts. In
	the most important of these, the connection between humanity and
	nature, the human individual was a microcosm whose structure
	corresponded to that of the macrocosm. Each individual included the
	whole world within itself. This was an active connection: when God
	created the world, he had not completed the job, and to rectify the
	remaining imperfections required human subjective activity. Indeed,
	the question: 'why did God create the world?' could only be answered
	in terms of his need for humanity to do this work. Through his own
	personality and imagination, the Magus called down cosmic forces,
	which his knowledge enabled him to direct. This was the Great Work
	of creation, in which he participated. Thus he identified himself
	with the world, even with God. (You had to be careful: in the wrong
	hands, this knowledge could bring demons instead of angels into the
	picture: big trouble. So to become an 'adept' required a long
	apprenticeship, in which false ideas were purged.) Boehme, and
	following him Hegel, used many of these notions to link God, Nature
	and individual psychology. Thus Boehme writes:

	The book in which all secrets lie hidden is man himself; he himself
	is the Book of the Essence of all Essences... He is like unto
	God... Why do you seek God in the depths or beyond the stars?
	...Seek him in your heart, in the centre of your life's
	origin. There shall you find Him.

18. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Enlightenment, denouncing
	such notions as superstitious nonsense, swept them aside or forced
	them underground. But they did not entirely disappear. Not only did
	Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry preserve some of their symbols, but
	Hermetic ideas as a whole remained current. Their adherents included
	people like Fichte, Schelling, Goethe, Shelley and Blake. In the
	twentieth century, trends as diverse as WB Yeats, Surrealism and
	Jungian psycho-analysis have drawn on them with enthusiasm.

19. Opposing Enlightenment thinking at every point, the *Phenomenology
	of Spirit*, the prologue to Hegel's system, was designed to overcome
	formal rationality, which walls us off from the truth. Science
	\[*Wissenschaft*\] can then enter 'the realm of pure thought',
	which, Hegel explains 'is the exposition of God as he is in his
	eternal essence, before the creation of nature and of a finite
	mind.' (*Science of Logic*, Introduction.)

	Reason, inseparable from the Will and a part of Being, is the realm
	where Nature and human spirit live and act. However, Hegel has
	reworked all these trends, absorbing many aspects of the
	Enlightenment in the course of his critique. In particular, Hegel's
	concept of Spirit, which is self-creating, like the heretic God,
	develops human social forms. For Hegel, family, civil society and
	the State make up 'objective spirit'. Religion presents in the form
	of 'picture-thinking' (eg mythology) the same content as philosophy
	develops conceptually.

20. To orthodox Christianity, humans were united, because they were all
	God's creatures. To the Enlightenment -- for instance, in political
	economy -- the relations between individual humans were external to
	them. Hegel rarely uses the word 'community' \[*Allgemeinschaft*\],
	but when he does it usually refers to the religious community, and
	all social unity, including the State, is something spiritual.

21. Humans have been trying to understand the world and their own place
	in it for a long time. This has generally taken the form of some
	kind of religious or mythical account which helped to shape the way
	people lived. This was how they thought about their lives, their
	origins and their destiny. In modern, more 'enlightened' times, the
	attempt is made to explain the world without such stories,
	dismissing them as mere superstition. But that leaves the big
	question unanswered: 'In what kind of world is it possible for
	conscious humanity to exist?' In the orthodox versions of the three
	big Western religions, Almighty God, (who was, naturally, bound up
	with the almighty powers on Earth), produced the whole show and
	wrote the script. If you complained about how dreadful it was, you
	were fobbed off with a story about free will; this was God's alibi,
	a clever trick by the Divinity to put all the blame on us
	mortals.[^11] Orthodoxy like this leaves no space for human
	freedom, for subjective activity: the Almighty has the whole thing
	sown up. In particular, our social relations are given to us by this
	higher power. But the atheists, and especially the Enlightenment
	materialists, who easily settled this entire discussion with the
	word 'superstition', left no more space for subjectivity than their
	opponents: we are just matter in motion, governed by the laws of
	Nature, they said. Spinoza had no trouble identifying the laws of
	nature with God's will, and Hegel shows that Enlightenment and
	superstition in the end agree with each other. 'Marxism', coming up
	with 'material laws of history', locked the gates still more
	securely.

22. Ludwig Feuerbach (1804-1872) abandoned his theological studies and
	decided -- against parental disapproval -- in favour of philosophy
	under Hegel in Berlin. At the end of the 1830s, the Hegelian school
	started to disintegrate. After writing some Hegelian books on the
	history of philosophy, Feuerbach began to break away from the
	Hegelian system, and was soon the leader of the 'Left' or 'Young'
	Hegelians. In 1841, he published his chief work, *The Essence of
	Christianity*, followed by *Preliminary Theses for the Reform of
	Philosophy* and *Foundations of the Philosophy of the Future*.

	Like the other Left Hegelians, Feuerbach was first of all concerned
	with religion. Unlike some of his fellow-rebels, however, he did not
	merely denounce religion, which he described as 'the first and
	indirect self-consciousness of man'. Where his teacher Hegel had
	made human self-consciousness the way that God is conscious of
	Himself, Feuerbach makes 'what man knows of God' an upside-down form
	of 'what man knows of himself'. Religion is a projection of the best
	of humanity, 'the human essence', human feeling, willing, thinking,
	love, on to something which appears as other than human, the product
	of imagination \[*Phantasie*\]. But this is the root of human
	enslavement.

	Man -- this is the mystery of religion -- projects his essence into
	objectivity and then makes himself the image of this projected image
	of himself thus converted into a subject, a person; he thinks of
	himself as an object to himself, but as the object of an object, of
	another being than himself. (*Essence*)

	Feuerbach sees the demystification of this process as the way to
	freedom: 'What in religion is a predicate we must make into a
	subject'. Describing Hegel's 'theological idealism', he says that
	'man's consciousness of God is the self-consciousness of
	God... Thus does absolute philosophy externalise from man his own
	essence and activity.' (*Principles*) Theology, not religion, is
	Feuerbach's target. When it formalises the study of God, theology
	becomes 'the worst enemy of the awakened spirit'. In his earlier
	writing, Feuerbach had quoted Boehme's personal understanding of God
	with approval. Now, he praises Boehme for understanding that God has
	His material body in nature. His critique of Hegel is that the
	formal reasoning of the Hegelian system is disguised theology,
	excluding the personal.[^12] But in this, Feuerbach is criticising
	the whole of philosophy, philosophy as such. That is what he means
	by 'the new philosophy'.

	Just as theology transforms the determinations of man into divine
	determinations -- through depriving them of their own determination
	by which they are what they are -- so also in precisely the same way
	does philosophy deprive them... So does absolute philosophy
	externalise and alienate from man his own essence and
	activity. Hence the violence and torture that it inflicts on our
	minds. (*Principles*)

	'The new philosophy makes man -- with the inclusion of nature as the
	foundation of man -- the unique, universal and highest object of
	philosophy.' (*Principles*) As he famously explained himself: 'My
	religion is -- no religion. My philosophy -- no philosophy.'

23. Does Feuerbach represent a step backwards from Hegel towards the
	Enlightenment? Yes and no. It is more of a sideways move. While it
	does not ignore Hegel's critical attitude to Kant and his
	predecessors, it still denies its religious implications and
	re-establishes the Enlightenment's view of the human as an isolated
	individual. The only social relation Feuerbach knows is the 'love'
	(what kind is unspecified!) between two characters called 'I' and
	'thou'. To illustrate all this, it might be helpful to sketch
	briefly the history of Anselm's so-called 'ontological proof of
	God's existence. Tidied up by Descartes, this says that, since God
	is the most perfect being we can conceive, and since perfection must
	surely include existence... Kant famously and unceremoniously
	knocked this on the head: if I think I have 100 talers in my pocket,
	that is not the same as actually having them!

	Hegel is not impressed with this wisecrack. 'When we speak of "God",
	we are referring to an object of quite a different kind than one
	hundred talers'. 'The true cognition of God begins with our knowing
	that things in their immediate being have no truth.' Feuerbach
	(*Principles*, para 25), however, wants to re-establish Kant's
	argument against Hegel's mockery.

24. Karl Marx, when he submits his Doctoral Thesis in 1841, is quite
	cheeky about religious ideas in general, of course. But he agrees
	with Hegel that Kant has proved nothing.

	The proofs of the existence of God are... mere hollow
	tautologies. Take for instance the ontological proof. This only
	means: 'that which I conceive for myself in a real way (*realiter*)
	is a real concept for me' something that works on me. In this sense,
	all gods, the pagan as well as the Christian, have possessed a real
	existence. Did not the ancient Moloch reign? Was not the Delphic
	Apollo a real power in the life of the Greeks? Kant's critique means
	nothing in this respect. If somebody imagines that he has a hundred
	talers, if he believes in it, these hundred imagined talers have for
	him the same value as a hundred real talers. For instance, he will
	incur debts on the strength of his imagination, his imagination will
	work, in the same way as all humanity has incurred debts on its
	gods.

	The analogy between religion and money was to remain a focal point
	of Marx's work for the rest of his life. But before he can even
	begin to clarify this powerful notion, he has to undertake a
	critique of Enlightenment political ideas.

25. For over two years, Marx is a great admirer of Feuerbach. This
	covers the period of some of his most important early work: the
	*Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of the State*, the *Introduction* to
	this*, On the Jewish Question*, the *Holy Family* and, above all,
	the *Paris Manuscripts of 1844*. And yet, whatever Marx himself
	might have thought, these works give a very different content to
	Feuerbach, even when Marx uses the same words. Look, for example, at
	the famous passage on religion from the Introduction.

	The basis of irreligious criticism is: Man makes religion, religion
	does not make man. Religion is the self-consciousness and
	self-esteem of man who has either not yet found himself or has
	already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being encamped
	outside the world. Man is the world of men, the state, society. This
	state, this society, produce religion, an inverted
	world-consciousness, because they are an inverted world. Religion is
	the general theory of that world, its encyclopedic *point
	d'honeur*, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn
	complement, its universal source of consolation and
	justification. It is the fantastic realisation of the human essence,
	because the human essence has no true reality. The struggle against
	religion is therefore indirectly a fight against the world of which
	religion is the spiritual aroma. Religious distress is at the same
	time the expression of real distress and also the protest against
	real distress. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the
	heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of spiritless
	conditions. It is the opium of the people.

	Karl Marx is not an atheist, merely saying 'No' where religion says
	'Yes'. His fight against all mystification preserves its truth and
	makes it available to everybody. As he explains in a letter of late
	1842,

	I requested further that religion should be criticised in the
	framework of criticism of political conditions rather than that
	political conditions should be criticised in the framework of
	religion, since this is more in accord with the nature of a
	newspaper and the educational level of the reading public; for
	religion itself is without content, it owes its being not to heaven
	but to the earth, and with the abolition of distorted reality, of
	which it is the theory, it will collapse of itself. Finally, I
	desired that, if there is to be talk of philosophy, there should be
	less trifling with the label 'atheism' (which reminds one of
	children, assuring everyone who is ready to listen, that they are
	not afraid of the bogy man), and that instead the content of
	philosophy should be brought to the people.

	Marx follows Feuerbach in tracing the basis of religious belief in
	human life, but while Feuerbach locates this in individual human
	psychology, Marx is concerned chiefly with the social conditions of
	the human.

26. In 1844, Marx embarks on his life-long task: the critique of
	political economy. In his reading of James Mill, he turns again to
	the analogy between economic relations and religion:

	Since man alienates this mediating activity itself, he is active
	here only as a man who has lost himself and is dehumanised; the
	relation itself between things, man's operation with them, becomes
	the operation of an entity outside man and above man. Owing to this
	alien mediator -- instead of man himself being the mediator for man
	-- man regards his will, his activity and his relation to other men
	as a power independent of him and them.

	This analogy of Christ as the mediator and monetary relations was to
	recur many times in Marx's work. It enables him to begin to grasp
	the nature of social relations in general and the process through
	which social labour creates the truly human and opens the path to
	human freedom. At the same time, in its modern alienated forms, it
	blocks this path.

27. The last of the Paris Manuscripts, '*Critique of the Hegelian
	Dialectic and Philosophy as a Whole*', begins with some of Marx's
	most fulsome praise of Feuerbach. And yet the ideas Marx begins to
	develop here leave Feuerbach far behind. Marx enters into a detailed
	critical discussion of the last chapter of Hegel's *Phenomenology*,
	'Absolute Knowing'. Philosophy transcends 'Revealed Religion',
	which, Hegel says, is defective only in that it has not made 'its
	actual self-consciousness the object of its consciousness'. Having
	learned from Feuerbach that Hegel makes the human being 'the same as
	self-consciousness', Marx is able to transform Hegel's upside-down
	picture into an understanding of man as a 'human natural being', not
	an isolated individual, but a social being.

	As everything natural has to come into being, man too has his act of
	origin -- history -- which, however, is for him a known history, and
	hence as an act of origin, is a conscious self-transcending act of
	origin...

	Within his inverted philosophical picture,

	Hegel conceives labour as man's act of self-genesis -- conceives
	man's relation to himself as an alien being and the manifestation of
	himself as an alien being to be the emergence of
	species-consciousness and species-life.

28. It is some time in 1845 before Marx has seen how great was the
	distance between his critique of Hegel and that of Feuerbach. When
	he scribbles down his Eleven *Theses on Feuerbach*, this is how he
	begins:

	The main defect of all hitherto-existing materialism -- that of
	Feuerbach included -- is that the Object \[*der Gegenstand*\],
	actuality, sensuousness, are conceived only in the form of the
	object \[*Objekts*\], or of contemplation \[*Anschauung*\], but not
	as human sensuous activity, practice \[*Praxis*\], not
	subjectively. Hence it happened that the active side, in opposition
	to materialism, was developed by idealism -- but only abstractly,
	since, of course, idealism does not know real, sensuous activity as
	such. Feuerbach wants sensuous objects, differentiated from
	thought-objects, but he does not conceive human activity itself as
	objective activity. In *Das Wesen des Christenthums*, he therefore
	regards the theoretical attitude as the only genuinely human
	attitude, while practice is conceived and defined only in its
	dirty-Jewish form of appearance. Hence he does not grasp the
	significance of 'revolutionary', of practical-critical, activity.

	The doctrine which called itself 'Marxism' was never able to handle
	this. Plekhanov, the man who formulated the main ideas of 'Marxism'
	-- 'dialectical materialism', 'historical materialism' etc. -- never
	brought himself to discuss this text, and nor did his most famous
	pupil, VI Lenin. Marx criticises materialism as it had grown up in
	the eighteenth century and lumps Ludwig Feuerbach's materialism
	together with it. The defect of this outlook, Marx explains, is that
	it is able to grasp knowledge only in opposition to both the object
	of knowledge and the knowing subject. It could not understand the
	activity of knowing the world in terms of the rest of human social
	and individual activity. It was German idealism -- not just Hegel
	but Fichte and Schelling too -- which 'developed the active
	side'. We have been discussing the long tradition of religious and
	magical thought associated with this achievement.

29. Thesis 3 is also important here.

	The materialist doctrine concerning the changing of circumstances
	and upbringing forgets that circumstances are changed by men and
	that the educator must himself be educated. This doctrine must
	therefore divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to
	society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of
	human activity or self-change can be conceived and rationally
	understood only as revolutionary practice.

	So the 'active side' is not just a matter of material productive
	activity. It also arises if you consider the transformation of the
	social relations and conditions within which production takes
	place. Marx now knows that freedom has to include the creation by
	humans of the relation between them. It is worth recalling here a
	well-known passage in the *German Ideology*, written just after the
	*Theses*.

	Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist
	consciousness, and for the success of the cause itself, the
	alteration of men on a mass scale is, necessarily, an alteration
	which can only take place in a practical movement, a revolution;
	this revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the ruling
	class cannot be overthrown in any other way, but also because the
	class overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed in ridding
	itself of all the muck of ages and become fitted to found society
	anew.

	Here too, when he speaks about the communist revolution, Marx is
	focussing on the notion of self-change. 'The alteration of men on a
	mass scale' can only be the work of these same humans. He never had
	any time for transformation brought about by people at the top,
	well-meaning chaps who could be trusted to look after the interests
	of the little people.

30. A major task still lies ahead, for I have not touched Marx's most
	important -- and unfinished -- contribution: *Capital*. I think that
	reconsideration of many familiar passages in all three volumes would
	show a different side if read in the light of Hegel's theological
	ideas and Marx's critical reworking of them. (Two examples: in
	Volume 1, like Chapter 1, Section 4, 'The Fetish-Character of
	Commodities':

	The veil is not removed from the countenance of the social
	life-process, ie the process of material production, until it
	becomes production by freely-associated men, and stands under their
	conscious and planned control.

	Or Chapter 7, Section 1, on 'The Labour Process':

	> He acts upon external nature and changes it, and in this way he
	> simultaneously changes his own nature.

	Just to suggest what this might yield, let us look at a few
	sentences from the 'Results of the Immediate Process of
	Production'. (This is the planned Part 7 of Volume 1 which Marx
	decided not to include.)

	> ...Hence the rule of the capitalist over the worker is the rule of
	> things over man, of dead labour over the living, of the product
	> over the producer. For the commodities that become the instruments
	> of rule over the workers (merely as the instruments of capital
	> itself) are mere consequences of the process of production; they
	> are its products. Thus at the level of material production, of the
	> life-process in the realm of the social -- for that is what the
	> process of production is -- we find the same situation that we
	> find in religion at the ideological level, namely, the inversion
	> of subject into object and vice versa. Viewed historically this
	> inversion is the indispensable transition without which wealth as
	> such, ie the relentless productive forces of social labour, which
	> alone form the material base of a free human society, could not
	> possible be created by force at the expense of the majority. This
	> antagonistic stage cannot be avoided, any more than it is possible
	> for man to avoid the stage in which his spiritual energies are
	> given a religious definition as powers independent of
	> himself. What we are confronted by here is the alienation
	> \[*Entfremdung*\] of man from his own labour.[^13]

	Here we can see Marx's acceptance of Feuerbach's influence and as
	well as that of Hegel's counter-influence, and the critique of
	both. Behind Hegel stretches centuries of mystical heresy. In front
	of Marx lies the prospect of a human society, one in which humans,
	social individuals, freely associate in creating their own life and
	their own interrelations.

[^1]: I used to link the critiques of political economy and Utopia with
	the critique of Hegelian dialectic, but I now want to place this
	third critical operation on a separate plane, for it includes and
	underlies each of the other two.
[^2]: Those who say that Marx did not completely understand Hegel are,
	of course, absolutely correct. Every great thinker must yield a mass
	of ideas which transcend any particular reading of his work. That is
	why Marx continually returned to Hegel to win yet further insights
	and to criticise him anew. Naturally, similar considerations apply
	to any reading of Marx.
[^3]: Note how these cover the items which Marx listed in the
	'superstructure' in his 1859 *Preface to the Critique of Political
	Economy*. Marx's idea of 'free association' implies the
	transcendence of each of these fields, that is, their dissolution in
	a human world of free creation.
[^4]: See, for instance, the last paragraphs of the *Encyclopedia*, the
	*Philosophy of Mind*, including the final quotation from Aristotle's
	*Metaphysics*. Compare Hegel's concluding three syllogisms, relating
	Universal, Particular and Individual, with the syllogisms of the
	holy Trinity, as few paragraphs earlier.
[^5]: The picture by MC Escher, in which each of two hands draws and is
	drawn by the other, might be a helpful. In each triad, the third
	term not only reconciles the opposition between the first two, but
	contains and preserves it.
[^6]: No wonder he was denounced while he was at Berlin, as both atheist
	and pantheist. In reply, he aggressively defended his Lutheran
	orthodoxy.
[^7]: It turns out that this is a Hadith, a saying much loved by the
	Sufis.
[^8]: To make its Christian point quite clear, the Inquisition also
	carefully smashed his bones to pieces.
[^9]: Glenn Magee's book *Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition*, (Cornell
	2001), was one of the starting-points for this work.
[^10]: Goethe's *Faust* is a mixture of Paracelsus and Agrippa. Hegel's
	friend Goethe was a practising alchemist.
[^11]: Buddhism is quite another matter, I'm told.
[^12]: It is also worth remembering that, in defending himself against
	the accusations of atheism and pantheism, Feuerbach wrote a book
	about Martin Luther, trying to show that the Great Reformer took his
	side in the argument.
