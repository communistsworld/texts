...

Dear Sir.

Yesterday I received a letter in which you demand from me a detailed
judgment of Proudhon. Lack of time prevents me from fulfilling your
desire. Added to which I have _none_ of his works to hand. However, in
order to assure you of my good will I will quickly jot down a brief
outline. You can then complete it, add to it or cut it -- in short do
anything you like with it[^1].

Proudhon's earliest efforts I no longer remember. His school work about
the _Langue universelle_ shows how unceremoniously he tackled problems
for the solution of which he still lacked the first elements of
knowledge.

His first work, _Qu'est-ce que la propriété?_, is undoubtedly his
best. It is epoch-making, if not because of the novelty of its content,
at least because of the new and audacious way of expressing old
ideas. In the works of the French socialists and communists he knew
_"propriété"_ had, of course, been not only criticized in various ways
but also _"abolished"_ in a utopian manner. In this book Proudhon stands
in approximately the same relation to Saint-Simon and Fourier as
Feuerbach stands to Hegel. Compared with Hegel, Feuerbach is certainly
poor. Nevertheless he was epoch-making _after_ Hegel because he laid
_stress_ on certain points which were disagreeable to the Christian
consciousness but important for the progress of criticism, points which
Hegel had left in mystic _clair-obscur_ \[semi-obscurity\].

In this book of Proudhon's there still prevails, if I may be allowed the
expression, a strong muscular style. And its style is in my opinion its
chief merit. It is evident that even where he is only reproducing old
stuff, Proudhon discovers things in an independent way --- that what he
is saying is new to him and is treated as new. The provocative defiance,
which lays hands on the economic "holy of holies", the ingenious paradox
which made a mock of the ordinary bourgeois understanding, the withering
criticism, the bitter irony, and, revealed here and there, a deep and
genuine feeling of indignation at the infamy of the existing order, a
revolutionary earnestness -- all these electrified the readers of
_Qu'est-ce que la propriété?_ and provided a strong stimulus on its
first appearance. In a strictly scientific history of political economy
the book would hardly be worth mentioning. But sensational works of this
kind have their role to play in the sciences just as much as in the
history of the novel. Take, for instance, Malthus' book on
_Population_. Its first edition was nothing but a _"sensational
pamphlet"_ and _plagiarism_ from beginning to end into the bargain. And
yet what a stimulus was produced by this _lampoon on the human race_!

If I had Proudhon's book before me I could easily give a few examples to
illustrate his _early style_. In the passages which he himself regarded
as the most important he imitates Kant's treatment of the _antinomies_
-- Kant was at that time the only German philosopher whose works he had
read, in translations -- and he leaves one with a strong impression that
to him, as to Kant, the resolution of the antinomies is something
_"beyond"_ human understanding, i.e., something that remains obscure to
him himself.

But in spite of all his apparent iconoclasm one already finds in
_Qu'est-ce que la propriété'?_ the contradiction that Proudhon is
criticizing society, on the one hand, from the standpoint and with the
eyes of a French small-holding peasant (later _petit bourgeois_) and, on
the other, that he measures it with the standards he inherited from the
socialists.

The deficiency of the book is indicated by its very title. The question
is so badly formulated that it cannot be answered correctly. _Ancient
"property relations"_ were superseded by _feudal_ property relations and
the feudal by _"bourgeois"_ property relations. Thus history itself had
expressed its criticism upon past _property relations_. What Proudhon
was actually dealing with was _modern bourgeois property_ as it exists
today. The question of what this is could have only been answered by a
critical analysis of _"political economy"_, embracing the totality of
these _property relations_, considering not their _legal_ aspect as
_relations of volition_ but their real form, that is, as _relations of
production_. But as Proudhon entangled the whole of these economic
relations in the general legal concept of _"property"_, _"la
propriété"_, he could not get beyond the answer which, in a similar work
published before 1789, Brissot had already given in the same words:
_"La propriété' c'est le vol"_.[^2]

The upshot is at best that the bourgeois legal conceptions of _"theft"_
apply equally well to the _"honest"_ gains of the bourgeois himself. On
the other hand, since _"theft"_ as a forcible violation of property
_presupposes the existence of property_, Proudhon entangled himself in
all sorts of fantasies, obscure even to himself, about _true bourgeois
property_.

During my stay in Paris in 1844 I came into personal contact with
Proudhon. I mention this here because to a certain extent I am also to
blame for his _"Sophistication"_, as the English call the adulteration
of commercial goods. In the course of lengthy debates often lasting all
night, I infected him very much to his detriment with Hegelianism,
which, owing to his lack of German, he could not study properly. After
my expulsion from Paris Herr Karl Grün continued what I had begun. As
a teacher of German philosophy he also had the advantage over me that he
himself understood nothing about it.

Shortly before the appearance of Proudhon's second important work, the
_Philosophie de la misère, etc_., he himself announced this to me in a
very detailed letter in which he said, among other things: "_J'attends
votre férule critique_"[^3]. This criticism, however, soon dropped on
him (in my _Misère de la philosophie, etc_., Paris, 1847), in a way
which ended our friendship forever.

From what I have said here, you can see that Proudhon's _"Philosophie de
la misère ou Système des contradictions èconomiques"_ first contained
the real answer to the question _"Qu'est-ce que la propriété?"_ In fact
it was only after the publication of this work that he had begun his
economic studies; he had discovered that the question he had raised
could not be answered by _invective_, but only by an _analysis_ of
modern _"political economy"_. At the same time he attempted to present
the _system_ of economic categories dialectically. In place of Kant's
insoluble _"antinomies"_, the _Hegelian "contradiction"_ was to be
introduced as the means of development.

For an estimate of his book, which is in two fat volumes, I must refer
you to the refutation I wrote. There I have shown, among other things,
how little he had penetrated into the secret of scientific dialectics
and how, on the contrary, he shares the illusions of speculative
philosophy, for instead of regarding _economic categories as the
theoretical expression of historical relations of production,
corresponding to a particular stage of development in material
production_, he garbles them into pre-existing _eternal ideas_, and how
in this roundabout way he arrives once more at the standpoint of
bourgeois economy.[^4]

I show furthermore how extremely deficient and at times even
schoolboy-like is his knowledge of "political economy" which he
undertook to criticize, and that he and the utopians are hunting for a
so-called _"science"_ by means of which a formula for the "solution of
the social question" is to be devised _a priori_, instead of deriving
science from a critical knowledge of the historical movement, a movement
which itself produces the _material conditions of emancipation_. My
refutation shows in particular that Proudhon's view of _exchange-value_,
the basis of the whole theory, remains confused, incorrect and
superficial, and that he even mistakes the utopian interpretation of
_Ricardo's_ theory of value for the basis of a new science. With regard
to his general point of view I have summarized my conclusions thus:

> Every economic relation has a good and a bad side, it is the one point
> on which M. Proudhon does not give himself the lie. He sees the good
> side expounded by the economists; the bad side he sees denounced by
> the socialists. He borrows from the economists the necessity of
> eternal relations; he borrows from the socialists the illusion of
> seeing in poverty nothing but poverty (instead of seeing in it the
> revolutionary, destructive aspect which will overthrow the old
> society). He is in agreement with both in wanting to fall back upon
> the authority of science. Science for him reduces itself to the
> slender proportions of a scientific formula; he is the man in search
> of formulas. Thus it is that M. Proudhon flatters himself on having
> given a criticism of both political economy and of communism: he is
> beneath them both. Beneath the economists, since as a philosopher who
> has at his elbow a magic formula, he thought he could dispense with
> going into purely economic details; beneath the socialists, because he
> has neither courage enough nor insight enough to rise, be it even
> speculatively, above the bourgeois horizon... He wants to soar as the
> man of science above the bourgeois and the proletarians; _he is merely
> the petty bourgeois_, continually tossed back and forth between
> capital and labour, political economy and communism".

Severe though the above judgment may sound I must even now endorse every
word of it. At the same time, however, one has to bear in mind that when
I declared his book to be the code of socialism of the _petit bourgeois_
and proved this theoretically, Proudhon was still being decried as an
ultra-arch-revolutionary both by political economists and by
socialists. That is why later on I never joined in the outcry about his
_"treachery"_ to the revolution. It was not his fault that, originally
misunderstood by others as well as by himself, he failed to fulfil
unjustified hopes.

In the _Philosophie de la misère_ all the defects of Proudhon's method
of presentation stand out very unfavourably in comparison with
_Qu'est-ce que la propriété?_ The style is often what the French call
_ampoule_. High-sounding speculative jargon, purporting to be
German-philosophical, appears regularly on the scene when his Gallic
astuteness fails him. A noisy, self-glorifying, boastful tone and
especially the twaddle about _"science"_ and sham display of it, which
are always so unedifying, are continually jarring on one's ears. Instead
of the genuine warmth which permeates his first work, he here
systematically works himself up into a sudden flush of rhetoric in
certain passages. There is in addition the clumsy repugnant show of
erudition of the self-taught, whose natural pride in his original
reasoning has already been broken and who now, as a _parvenu_ of
science, feels it necessary to give himself airs with what he neither is
nor has. Then the mentality of the petty bourgeois who for instance
makes an indecently brutal attack, which is neither shrewd nor profound
nor even correct, on a man like Cabet -- worthy of respect for his
practical attitude towards the French proletariat and on the other hand
pays compliments to a man like Dunoyer (a "State Councillor", it is
true) although the whole significance of this Dunoyer lay in the comic
zeal with which, throughout three fat, unbearably boring volumes, he
preached a rigorism characterised by Helvetius as follows: "_On veut que
les malheureux soient parfaits_"[^5].

The February Revolution certainly came at a very inconvenient moment for
Proudhon, who had irrefutably proved only a few weeks before that _"the
era of revolutions"_ was past for ever. His speech in the National
Assembly, however little insight it showed into existing conditions, was
worthy of every praise. _After_ the June insurrection it was an act of
great courage. In addition it had the fortunate consequence that
M. _Thiers_, by his reply opposing Proudhon's proposals, which was then
issued as a special booklet, proved to the whole of Europe what
infantile catechism served this intellectual pillar of the French
bourgeoisie as a pedestal. Compared with M. Thiers, Proudhon indeed
swelled to the size of an antediluvian colossus.

Proudhon's discovery of "_crédit gratuit_"[^6] and the _"people's bank"_
(banque du peuple), based upon it, were his last economic "deeds". My
book _A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Part I,
Berlin, 1859_ (pp. 59-64) contains the proof that the theoretical basis
of his idea arises from a misunderstanding of the basic elements of
bourgeois "political economy", namely of the relation between
_commodities_ and _money_, while the practical superstructure was simply
a reproduction of much older and far better developed schemes. That
under certain economic and political conditions the credit system can be
used to accelerate the emancipation of the working class, just as, for
instance, at the beginning of the eighteenth, and again later, at the
beginning of the nineteenth century in England, it facilitated the
transfer of wealth from one class to another, is quite unquestionable
and self-evident. But to regard _interest-bearing capital_ as the _main
form of capital_ and to try to make a particular form of the credit
system comprising the alleged abolition of interest, the basis for a
transformation of society is an out-and-out _petty-bourgeois_
fantasy. This fantasy, further diluted, can therefore actually already
be found among the _economic spokesmen of the English petty bourgeoisie
in the seventeenth century_. Proudhon's polemic with Bastiat (1850)
about interest-bearing capital is on a far lower level than the
_Philosophie de la misère_. He succeeds in getting himself beaten even
by Bastiat and breaks into burlesque bluster when his opponent drives
his blows home.

A few years ago Proudhon wrote a prize essay on Taxation, the
competition was sponsored, I believe, by the government of
Lausanne. Here the last flicker of genius is extinguished. Nothing
remains but the _petit bourgeois tout pur_.

So far as Proudhon's political and philosophical writings are concerned
they all show the same contradictory, dual character as his economic
works. Moreover their value is purely local, confined to
France. Nevertheless his attacks on religion, the church, etc., were of
great merit locally at a time when the French socialists thought it
desirable to show by their religiosity how superior they were to the
bourgeois Voltairianism of the eighteenth century and the German
godlessness of the nineteenth. Just as Peter the Great defeated Russian
barbarism by barbarity, Proudhon did his best to defeat French
phrase-mongering by phrases.

His work on the _Coup d'état_, in which he flirts with Louis Bonaparte
and, in fact, strives to make him palatable to the French workers, and
his last work, written against _Poland_, in which for the greater glory
of the tsar he expresses moronic cynicism, must be described as works
not merely bad but base, a baseness, however, which corresponds to the
petty-bourgeois point of view.

Proudhon has often been compared to Rousseau. Nothing could be more
erroneous. He is more like Nicolas Linguet, whose _Théorie des loix
civiles_, by the way, is a very brilliant book.

Proudhon had a natural inclination for dialectics. But as he never
grasped really scientific dialectics he never got further than
sophistry. This is in fact connected with his petty-bourgeois point of
view. Like the historian Raumer, the petty bourgeois is made up of
_on-the-one-hand_ and _on-the-other-hand_. This is so in his economic
interests and _therefore_ in his politics, religious, scientific and
artistic views. And likewise in his morals, _in everything_. He is a
living contradiction. If, like Proudhon, he is in addition an ingenious
man, he will soon learn to play with his own contradictions and develop
them according to circumstances into striking, ostentatious, now
scandalous now brilliant paradoxes. Charlatanism in science and
accommodation in politics are inseparable from such a point of
view. There remains only one governing motive, the _vanity_ of the
subject, and the only question for him, as for all vain people, is the
success of the moment, the éclat of the day. Thus the simple moral
sense, which always kept a Rousseau, for instance, from even the
semblance of compromise with the powers that be, is bound to disappear.

Posterity will perhaps sum up the latest phase of French development by
saying that Louis Bonaparte was its Napoleon and Proudhon its
Rousseau-Voltaire.

You yourself have now to accept responsibility for having imposed upon
me the role of a judge of the dead so soon after this man's death.

Yours very respectfully,\
Karl Marx
