It is vital to be quite clear about the question of state capitalism
in order to reset the compasses that have lost their bearings[^fn-1].

We have managed to gather many contributions to this question from
the range of traditional concepts of the marxist school that show that
state capitalism is not only the latest aspect of the bourgeois world,
but that its forms, even complete ones, are very old and correspond
with the very emergence of the capitalist type of production. They
served as the main factors in primitive accumulation and long preceded
the fictitious and conventional environment of _private enterprise_,
of _free initiative_ and other fine things which are found far more
in the field of apology than in the real world.

As we have already said, there are many groups in the camp of the
left communist anti-stalinists who do not see things in this way. We
say to them, on the basis of earlier texts, for example: "Wherever it
may be, wherever there is the economic form of the market, capitalism
is a _social_ force. It is a _class_ force. And it has the political
_state_ at its disposal."[^fn-2]

And let us add the formula which, for us, expresses very well the
most recent aspects of the world economy: "State capitalism is not
a subjugation of _capital_ to the _state_, but a firmer subjugation
of the _state_ to _capital_."

These groups, however, find the terms of the first thesis were:
"correct until 1900, the epoch of the opening of imperialist expansion
and, as such, remain up to date, but are incomplete when the evolution
of capitalism gave to the state the function of taking over the final
moments of such an evolution from private initiative."

And they continue by saying that we will be late-comers in the world
of economic "culture" if we fail to understand that where this thesis
fails to fit in with history, it ceases to be marxist, and if we do
not request the addition of the study of the _state economy_ to Marx's
analysis, taking this from texts written by the _powerful personality_
of the economist Kaiser[^fn-3]. A bad habit! A text which seeks to
establish given relations between things and facts is checked against
_things_ and _facts_ and not against the signature on the book, which
is based on the more or less powerful or powerless _personality_
of the author.

Personalities? Stick them up your Kaiser as far as we are
concerned! And if in 1950 the idol of private enterprise is corroded,
we well know that Sir Karl reduced this to minute fragments a good
century ago: you see we know this because we are stubborn late-comers,
lazy in reading the latest books...

In Marxism, the concept of private initiative does _not exist_: look
down at the compass dial, not up to heaven like the person who hears
paradoxes (paradox -- something which common sense says is incorrect
when it is very much correct).

We have said in thousands of speeches of propaganda that the
socialist programme is for the _abolition of private property_ of
the means of production, which is borne out by Marx's _Critique
of the Gotha Programme_ and Lenin on Marx. We said _property_
and not private _economy_. The precapitalist economy was private,
or individual. Property is a term which does not indicate a
purely economic relationship, but also a legal one and brings into
discussion not just the productive forces, but also the relations
of production. Private property means private right sanctified by
bourgeois legal codes: it brings us to the _state_ and to power,
a matter of force and violence in the hands of a class. Our old and
valid formula means nothing if it does not already contain the concept
that in order to overcome the capitalist economy, the juridical and
state structure corresponding to it must also be overcome.

These basic concepts should suffice to reject the insidious content of
the following thesis: the social programme is enacted when individual
property becomes state property, when the factory is nationalised.

Let us be quite clear, the groups with which we are in dispute do
not state that state capitalism is already socialism, but fall into
saying that it is a third and new form between _private_ capitalism
and socialism. They say in fact that there are two distinct periods:
that in which "the state has more of the older policing function than
that of involvement in the economy", and that in which "it gives
the maximum power to the exercise of force specifically to protect
the economy centralised in it". We say that in these two formulae,
which are more or less faithfully reproduced, and even more so the
two historical periods, that capitalism is the same, the ruling
class is the same, and the historical state is the same. The economy
is the entire social field in which production and distribution
occur and includes the men participating in this: the state is a
specific organisation acting in the social field, and the state in
the capitalist period has _always_ had the function of policeman
and protector of the interests of a class and a type of production
corresponding historically with this class. The state concentrating
the economy within itself is an incongruous formula. For marxism,
the state is _always_ present in the economy; its power and _legal_
violence are economic factors from first to last. One can best explain
it this way: in certain cases, the state, with its administration,
assumes the management of industrial concerns; and if it assumes
the management of all of them, then it will have centralised the
_management_ of the concerns, but not of the _economy_. Especially so
long as distribution takes place with money prices (that these are
fixed officially does not matter) the state is a firm among firms,
a contractor among contractors; all the worse in that it considers
as _firms_ each of its national enterprises, as with the Labourites,
Churchillians and Stalinists. Getting away from this situation is not
a question of administrative measures, but a problem of revolutionary
force, of class war.

The problem is posed better in an interesting bulletin published
by the comrades of the "_Groupe fran√ßais de la gauche communiste
internationale_"[^fn-4] of which -- with great pleasure -- we do not
know the names and _personalities_. Sensible questions are asked on
the problem which deserve further development, and the problem is
posed in contrast to the vision of the noted Chaulieu group, which is
influenced by the theory of "decadence" and of the transition from
capitalism to _barbarism_ which inspires in them, however, the same
horror as that of the "bureaucratic" regimes. A theory in which one
does not know what on earth the compasses are indicating until they
prattle about marxism. There are elements in the internal bulletin
of our movement[^fn-5] on the _decadence_ of capitalism where we deal
with the false theory of the descending curve. Without any haughtiness
scientifically speaking, it is only foolishness to tell a story which
reads: Oh capitalism, grab us, swindle us, reduce us to a worn out old
dog not worth a kick in the ribs, we will quickly recover -- all this
just means that you are decaying. Just imagine that it is decaying...

As for barbarism, it is the opposite of _civilisation_ and so of
_bureaucracy_. Our barbarian ancestors, lucky them, did not have
organisational apparatuses based (old Engels!) on two elements --
a defined ruling class and a defined territory. There was the clan,
the tribe, but still not the _civitas_. _Civitas_ means city and also
state. Civilisation is the opposite of barbarism and means state
organisation, therefore necessarily bureaucracy. More state means
more civilisation means more bureaucracy, while _class civilisations_
follow one upon the other. This is what marxism says. It is not
the return to barbarism, but the start of _supercivilisation_,
which is duping us everywhere, that the monsters of contemporary
state super-organisations dominate. But let us leave the members of
_Socialisme ou barbarie_ to their existential crisis. The bulletin we
quoted refutes them in an article with the correct title: _Deux ans de
bavardage_: Two years of chattering -- No chattering here, please note!

Let us come to the balanced formula with which the French comrades
formulated the question: _the definition of the ruling class of the
state capitalist countries, the exactitude or insufficiency of the
definition: capitalism heir to the liberal revolutions_.

The conclusion presented by this group is correct: stop presenting
the bureaucracy as an autonomous class, perfidiously warmed-up
within the proletariat, and instead consider it as a huge apparatus
linked to a given historical situation in the world-wide evolution
of capitalism. Here we are on the right track. The bureaucracy, which
all class societies have known, is not a class, it is not a productive
force, it is one of the "forms" of production appropriate to a given
cycle of class rule. In certain historical phases it appears to be the
protagonist on the stage -- we too were about to say in the phase of
decadence -- they are in fact pre-revolutionary phases and those of
maximum expansion. Why call the society ready for the _midwife of the
revolution_, the obstetrician who will give birth to the new society,
decadent? The pregnant woman is not decadent, but the sterile one
is. Chaulieu sees the inflated belly of capitalist society and mistakes
the inadequate skill of the obstetrician confronted with the swollen
uterus with the imaginary infertility of the pregnant woman. They
accuse the Kremlin bureaucracy of giving us a still-born socialism due
to their abuse of power, while the fault lies in not having taken up
the forceps of the revolution to open up the belly of Europe-America,
driven by flourishing capital accumulation, and having made a useless
effort on an infertile womb. And perhaps only on an infertile womb,
inverting the battle for grain with the battle for seed[^fn-6].

Let us go on to the purely marxist-economic point after this
brief clarification. The statement "capitalism heir to the liberal
revolutions", which correctly made the central point, contains the
precise historical thesis: capitalism has a cycle, a single class
course, from the bourgeois to the proletarian revolution, and it
cannot be split into several cycles without renouncing revolutionary
marxism. But, it must be said, as it is said a little further on,
capitalism appeared from the _bourgeois_ (not _liberal_) revolutions
or, better still, "anti-feudal" revolutions. In fact liberalism
became the goal and motive of these revolutions, their general idea,
only through bourgeois apologetics. Marx rejected this and for him
the historical goal of these revolutions is the destruction of the
obstacles to the domination of the capitalist class.

Only in that sense is the abbreviated formulation correct. It is quite
clear: capital can easily get rid of liberalism without changing its
nature. And this is also clear: the direction of the _degeneration_,
the degeneration of the revolution in Russia does not pass from the
revolution for communism to the revolution for a _developed kind_ of
capitalism, but to a _pure_ capitalist revolution. It runs in parallel
with world-wide capitalist domination which, by successive steps,
eliminates old feudal and Asiatic forms in various zones. While the
historical situation in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries caused the capitalist revolution to take liberal forms, in
the twentieth century it must have totalitarian and bureaucratic ones.

The difference is not due to basic qualitative variations of
capitalism, but to the huge diversity in quantitative development,
as with the intensity in each metropole, and the diffusion over the
planet's surface.

The fact that capitalism decreasingly adopts for its conservation,
just as for its development and enlargement, liberal chit-chat and
ever increasingly uses police methods and bureaucratic suffocation,
when the historical line is clearly seen, does not cause the slightest
hesitation over the certainty that the same means must serve in the
proletarian revolution. It will make use of this violence, power,
state and bureaucracy, _despotism_ as the Manifesto called it with
a yet more dreadful term 103 years ago. Then it will know how to get
rid of all of them.

The surgeon does not put down the blood stained lancet before the
new life has emerged and has drawn its first breath, the hymn to life.

# Yesterday

Does not the basic form of capitalism disappear with the disappearance
of the private individuals who, as owners of factories, organise
production? This is the objection in the economic field which attracts
many people's attention.

"The capitalist" is named a hundred times by Marx. Besides, the
word "capital" comes from the word _caput_, meaning head, and so
traditionally capital is any wealth linked, _intestate_, to any
singular titular person. _However_, the thesis to which we have
dedicated expositions for a long time doesn't contain anything new,
but only explains, remaining true, that the marxist analysis of
capitalism does not consider as vital the element of the _person_
of the factory owner.

Quotations from Marx would be innumerable: let us then conclude with
just one.

Let us take the so called "classic" capitalism of the "free"
factory. Marx always put these in quotation marks, they in fact
characterise the bourgeois school he fought and destroyed with his
economic concepts -- this is the point that is always forgotten.

One naturally supposes that Mr. X, the first capitalist to appear,
had a sum of money to hand. Good. Entire sections of Marx's work
reply with the question: how come? The replies vary: theft, robbery,
usury, black marketeering or, as we have seen more than a few times,
royal charter or law of the land.

So X, instead of stashing his gold coins in a sack, so as to run
his fingers through them every night, acts as a citizen imbued with
liberal and humanitarian social ideals. He nobly faces the risks and
circulates his capital.

So, first element accumulated money.

Second element, acquisition of raw materials, the classic raw cotton
bales, of so many little chapters and paragraphs.

Third element, acquisition of the works where he sets up plant and
looms to spin and weave.

Fourth element, technical organisation and management. The classic
capitalist looks after this himself. He has studied, gone on trips
and journeys and has thought out new systems to work the bales and,
by producing thread in quantity, cuts costs. He will dress cheaply
yesterday's urchins and even the blacks of Central Africa who were
used to going about naked.

Fifth element, the workers at the looms. They do not have to bring an
ounce of raw cotton or a single spare spool -- that happened in the
semi-barbaric times of individual production. But at the same time
there will be trouble if they remove a single thread of cotton to
patch their trousers. They are rewarded with a just equivalent for
their labour time[^fn-7].

Through the combination of these elements, one achieves the one that
is the motive and the reason for the whole process: the mass of yarn
or textiles. The essential fact is that only the capitalist can take
this to market and the financial return is his and his alone.

Always the same old story. Yes, you know the little sum -- the cost of
the raw cotton, something for the wear and tear on plant and machinery,
the workers wages. Receipts: the price of the product sold. This is
greater than the sum of the costs and the difference constitutes the
profit margin of the factory.

It matters little that the capitalist does what he likes with the
money he gets back -- he could do that with his original cash already
without manufacturing anything. The important fact is that after
restocking in everything to the level of his original investment,
he still has a mass of money on hand. He could consume it himself,
certainly. But socially he _cannot_, and _something_ forces him to
in large part invest it, to translate it into capital again.

Marx says that the life cycle of capital consists only in its movement
as value perpetually set in motion so as to multiply itself. The desire
of the person of the capitalist is not required in this, nor would he
be able to impede it. Economic determinism not only obliges the worker
to sell his labour time, but similarly the capitalist to invest and
accumulate. Our criticism of liberalism does not consist in saying
there is a free class and a slave class. There is an exploited one
and a profiteering one, but they are both tied to the laws of the
historical capitalist mode of production.

The process is therefore not within the factory, but is _social_
and can only be understood as such. Already in Marx there is
the hypothesis of the separation of the various elements from
the person of the capitalist entrepreneur, which is substituted
with a share participation in the profit margin of the productive
enterprise. Firstly, the money can be got from a lender, a bank,
who receives periodic interest. Secondly, in such a case the
materials acquired with that money are not really the property of
the entrepreneur, but of the financier. Thirdly, in England the owner
of a building, house or factory may not be the owner of the land on
which it stands: thus houses and factories can be rented. Nothing
prohibits the same for looms and other machinery and tools. Fourth
element, the entrepreneur may lack technical and administrative
managerial capacities, he hires engineers and accountants. Fifth
element, workers' wages -- evidently their payment too is made from
loans from the financier.

The strict function of the entrepreneur is reduced to that of having
seen that there is a market demand for a certain mass of products which
have a sale price above the total cost of the preceding elements. Here
the capitalist class is restricted to the entrepreneurial class,
which is a social and political force, and the principal basis of the
bourgeois state. But the strata of entrepreneurs does not coincide
with that of money, land, housing and factory owners and commodity
suppliers.

There are two basic forms and points required to recognise
capitalism. One is that the right of the productive enterprise to
dispose of the products and the sales proceeds (controlled prices or
requisitions of commodities do not impair the right to such proceeds)
is unimpaired and unimpairable. What guards this central right in
contemporary society is from the outset a _class monopoly_, it is a
structure of power, and the state, the judiciary and police punish
whoever breaks this norm. Such is the condition for enterprise
production. The other point is that the social classes are not
isolated one from another. There are no longer, historically speaking,
castes or orders. Belonging to the landed aristocracy was something
that lasted more than one lifespan, as the title was handed down
through the generations. Ownership of buildings or large finances
lasts on average at least a lifespan. The "average period of personal
membership of a given individual to the ruling class" tends to become
even shorter. For this reason we are concerned about the extremely
developed form of _capital_, not the _capitalist_. This director does
not need fixed people. It finds and recruits them wherever it wants
and changes them in ever more mind bending shifts.

# Today

Here we cannot demonstrate that Lenin's "parasitic capitalism"
does not mean that power lies more in the hands of the financial
capitalists than in those of the industrial capitalists. Capitalism
could not spread and expand without growing more complicated and
progressively separating into the various elements which enter into
the competition for speculative gain: finance, technology, equipment,
administration. The tendency is for the largest margin and social
control to slip from the grasp of positive and active elements to
become concentrated in the hands of speculators and business banditry.

We shall therefore fly from Marx to... Don Sturzo.

This latter, with his habitual prudence, took in hand the INA
scandal[^fn-8]. What he said is interesting: "I cannot say what
happened during fascism because I was in America, but where these
things are the order of the day, many others may come to light!" We
can be sure of it. The capitalist parasitism of contemporary Italy
beats that of Mussolini, and both remain child's play in comparison
with wheeler-dealer US business.

INA had huge finances because it collected all the workers' social
security contributions, like other similar state institutions with
their well known initials. It pays slowly so its safes are stuffed with
ready cash. It therefore has the right (since it has no head, no body
and no soul -- it is for good reason that we are in the civilisation
of _habeus corpus_) not to let such wealth _lie idle_, so it employs
and invests it. What good luck for the modern entrepreneur! He is the
capitalist without capital, just as dialectically modern capital is
capital without the boss, acephalous.

The bad business, the clever Sicilian priest says (those in the
gallery yearn soon to make an exaggerated oration at his funeral)
was the formation of too many _front companies_ under the INA.

What the hell are front companies? Some types, versed in business
who have luxurious offices and have crept into the economic and
political outer offices, who do not have a penny or registered stock
or buildings to their names, (they do not even rent houses, but live
in big hotels, they know Vanoni[^fn-9] backwards, but Vanoni does
not know them[^fn-10]) "plan" a given deal and register a company
with the plan as its sole asset. INA, or some similar body, will
give it the money and if some "special law" is required, let us say
for raising cocks in old army bases, a problem is hastily brought to
the attention of national leaders, especially by a forceful speech on
government ineptitude by one of the opposition MPs, which solves all.

In fact, once the common impresario went to the bank to borrow money to
use in the business planned. The bank replied: good, here it is, where
are your securities? Out with your property and other titles... But
a state-run organisation does not have these trifling needs: the
_national good_ is enough for it to pull out the cash. The rest of the
tale tells itself. If the old impresario with his plan and production
project created not cocks but cock-ups, he was finished -- he did
not get his money back and he exited from the boss class humiliated.

Our _front company_ with its brilliant general staff does not live
in this fear: if it produces cocks, they are sold to poultry farmers
for a good price, money is earned. If, supposing it does not produce
cocks or no one wants cocks, no matter -- hand-outs, indemnities and
profit shares have all been cashed in and INA pays for the mistaken
cock farm plan.

We have explained what state capitalism (or the _economy centralised
in the state_) means by this small and banal example. It should be
said that INA's loss is shared by all the poor unfortunates who pay
into its coffers another cut of their daily wages.

State capitalism is finance concentrated in the state at the disposal
of passing wheeler-dealers of enterprise initiative. Never has free
enterprise been so free as when the profit remained but the loss risk
has been removed and transferred to the community.

The state alone can print as much money as it wants and can deal
with the forger. The progressive expropriation of small owners and
capitalist concentration in successive historical forms is based
on this initial principal of force. We have with reason repeatedly
stated that no economy in which firms present accounts and exchange
is carried out in money, can avoid such laws.

The power of the state is therefore based on the convergent interests
of these profiteers benefiting from speculative plans of firms and
from their web of deep-seated international relations.

How can these states not lend capital to those gangs which never
settle their debts with the state except by forcing the exploited
classes to pay up? There is the proof that these "capitalising"
states are in chronic debt to the bourgeois class, or if you want
fresh proof, it lies in the fact that they are obliged to borrow,
taking back their money and paying interest on it.

The socialist administration of a "centralised economy" would not
provide outside takings to any "plan" just as it would not pay
interest. Besides, it would not deal in money.

Capital is only _concentrated_ in the state for the convenience of
surplus-value and profit manoeuvring. It remains "available to all" or
available to the components of the entrepreneurial class -- no longer
simply production entrepreneurs, but openly business entrepreneurs
-- they no longer produce commodities, but, Marx has already said,
they produce surplus value.

The capitalist as person no longer serves in this -- capital lives
without him but with its same function multiplied 100 fold. The human
subject has become useless. A class without members to compose it? The
state not at the service of a social group, but an impalpable force,
the work of the Holy Ghost or of the Devil? Here is Sir Charles's
irony. We offer the promised quotation: "By turning his money
into commodities which serve as the building materials for a new
product, and as factors in the labour process, by incorporating living
labour into their lifeless objectivity, the capitalist simultaneously
transforms _value_, i.e. _past_ labour in its objectified and lifeless
form, into _capital_, _value which can perform its own valorisation
process_, an animated monster which begins to 'work', 'as if possessed
by the devil'."[^fn-11]

Capital must be seized by the horns.

actually sell and receive payment for their labour power -- their 
capacity to labour. The value of this labour power is its cost of 
reproduction: "the value of the means of subsistence necessary for the 
maintenance of its owner." (_Capital_ Vol. I, p 274) While the wage 
form gives the appearance that all a worker's labour is paid for, for 
Marx part of workers' labour time reproduces the value of their labour 
power and is thus "paid" -- and the rest of it is surplus to this and 
thus is "unpaid". (See _Capital_ Vol. I, chapters 6 & 7)
