Which is the braver? The man who falls in line with the great majority
or he that faces the wrath of millions for conscience sake?

Do not confound us with the pacifists. We believe in fighting. Aye, we
have been fighting all our lives -- fighting injustice, oppression, and
tyranny. Almost single handed at that.

We are not pacifists. But we want to know what we are fighting for, and
we refuse to fight for the enemies and the exploiters of humanity.
