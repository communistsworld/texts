Men are the products of their time: some are capable of representing it,
because the invariance of their thought overcomes the ideology of the
ruling class or expresses the impetuous assault of the oppressed class;
others dominate it, because they are capable of perceiving the moments
of discontinuity which mark the beginnings of the new stages of the
process of becoming of a given mode of production (especially the new
modes of production). In the former case we have the thought of
continuity, in the second, that of discontinuity. In other words, we
have traditional thought (in the non-pejorative sense) and revolutionary
thought. Rare are those who are capable of thinking in accordance with
both modalities, since this is not a case of a duality constituted by a
spatial juxtaposition, but rather that of a contradictory duality. It is
very often the case that the past and tradition weigh like a nightmare
on the brains of the living and prevent the emergence, the eruption, of
the present and the future -- which nonetheless operate in reality -- in
thought. This is true both during periods of social peace as well as in
times of revolutionary unrest, the former favoring traditionalist
expressions, while the latter are more likely to favor revolutionary
expressions.

Amadeo Bordiga perfectly expressed the dominant ideas of the communist
movement such as it developed after the Russian revolution and, at the
same time, he expressed what this movement is, transformed into an
ideological diaphragm: the real process of becoming -- that is, not
interpreted by Bolshevism or Leninism -- of society. But his struggle
against Leninist, Trotskyist and Stalinist deviations definitely
hindered his investigation. His resolve to absolutely refrain from
innovation, to restrict himself to commentary, to proving that
everything has already been explicitly set forth, led him to remain
within his limits. He was not one of those people who make a big splash
because they manage to present themselves as more than they really are
or because historical conditions have allowed them to surpass their
limits, filling them with a substance not their own. Bordiga was just
the opposite. He deliberately set limits for himself; he did not produce
what he was potentially capable of producing. That is why his work,
which is about the future, was inhibited or disguised by a kind of
revolutionary hermeneutics. It constantly restrained his will to define
the specificity of this epoch in which the rule of capital is even
stronger than it was before. Hence, in retrospect, the tragic character
of his existence.

This hermeneutic is not concerned so much with displaying the hidden
meaning of words and texts as it is with reestablishing the precise
connection between the proletariat and theory, seen as a set of laws
that rule the process of becoming of humanity towards communism and as a
description of that process; for Bordiga, what was necessary was to
refute the accumulated false meanings and contradictions upon which all
the deviations of the proletarian struggle are based. Thanks to theory,
the immediate consciousness of the class can be apprehended as a whole
and can take root, so to speak, instantaneously. Unfortunately, mere
hermeneutics do not suffice when it is something new that must be
confronted. And there's the rub. The study of this latter problem can
lead to an enrichment of theory. However, given the fact that the origin
of this enrichment would in that case be a certain well-determined
person, there would still be the possibility that this theoretical
complement could be personalized and given a name. It is necessary to
eliminate the person as subject. The party is the only institution that
must pursue, and is capable of doing so, the task of clarification and
enrichment to a good end -- in a very delimited sense. This is why it is
only when the International Communist Party grew to a certain size
(although it will always be a relatively small minority) that Bordiga
departed somewhat from his hermeneutics.

The best example of this may perhaps be found in this theoretical
formulation of "semi-finished products":

Now is certainly not the time to compile an encyclopedia, but to
understand the process of becoming of contemporary society, which can
only be studied with Marxist theory as the "fabric of the original
picture", and at the same time to be in a condition to apprehend the
transformations that have taken place in the last fifty years. Here the
method of "semi-finished products" runs the risk of becoming a
theoretical hodge-podge: as unexpected events take place, patches are
put on the theory to make it fit reality. This is why the hermeneutic
was necessarily insufficient. On the other hand, the revolution has
effected its return and our times are discontinuous in relation to the
revolutionary phase of 1917-1923. Capital has exceeded its limits: Karl
Marx had effectively counted on this, but he did not fully explain
it. At present there are far more con-games and theoretical obscenities
than there were ten years ago, but the demand for theoretical work that
dares to confront novelty as such is more urgent than it was then. In
any case, it is not a matter of discovering a new theory, but rather of
developing theory on the basis of the theory that arose in 1848, which
necessarily rules out the need for showcasing any names whatsoever. In
short, on this particular point, Bordiga's speech, possible in a period
of reflux, is totally inadequate for the current moment.

Bordiga's hermeneutics are after a fashion the complement of his
prophetic vision (in the literal sense).

> We have loudly proclaimed many times to those who are greedy for
> palpable, but contingent, political victories, that we are
> revolutionaries not because we need to experience and to see the
> revolution in our lifetimes, but because we see it now, for the
> different countries, for the 'fields' and the 'arenas' of social
> evolution in which Marxism classifies the inhabited earth, as an event
> that is already susceptible to scientific verification. The fixed
> coordinates of the communist revolution are written, like solutions to
> demonstrated laws, in the space-time of history[^2].

To defend theory is to defend the element that bridges the gulf created
by the counterrevolution, the gap between the last revolutionary phase
and the one that is to come. That is why this admonition echoes an
assertion from 1960:

> A revolutionary -- according to us -- is someone for whom the
> revolution is as certain as something that has already happened[^3].

And also this one from 1952:

> As a result, the problem of the praxis of the party does not consist
> in knowing the future, which would be too little, or wanting the
> future, which would be too much, but of 'preserving the line of the
> future of one's own class'[^4].

By means of his hermeneutics and his prophecy, Bordiga affirms the great
revolutionary potential of the class as it was when it unleashed its
last great battle. It is a matter of preserving this potential and, if
possible, of making it grow; one must remind the class of its mission
and at the same time mercilessly criticize it for having accepted the
leadership of cowardly, pusillanimous, treacherous leaders, and for
having surrendered to the world of the commodity and to the immediatism
of this "sordid civilization of the quiz show"; this class that no
longer responds, as in the past century, to the least insult against the
revolution, which in its own way makes possible the murder and massacre
of yellow people, blacks and Arabs, brutalized as it is by an
internalized cult of Mammon.

One is the prisoner to a certain extent of the cause one embraces. The
cause liberates and enchains, sometimes it paralyzes and inhibits. In
Bordiga, the old "problematic" of the party is largely based on a broad
vision of the party as the class[^5], on the vision of a human multitude
engaging in revolution without appealing to any great man or Messiah,
without glorifying anyone. All reverence, regardless of its object,
brings us closer to the earth, to the tomb; victory is impossible
without standing completely upright. And so in Bordiga we encounter
visionary eruptions of the future, the perception of the totality of
men, of the species; hence his multiform and torrential discourse. Hence
also the use of an unexpurgated language, not strictly defined or
nationalized. He borrows a multitude of words and expressions from
various Italian dialects to render his discourse more expressive, just
as he sows his writings with foreign words and phrases that more clearly
express what he wants to explain and more accurately embody his thought,
which is that of a being who even escapes, even if only in part, the
linguistic despotism of capital:

> They can turn their faces, incapable of shame, towards the same crowd,
> the false spokesmen for the modern proletariat who have cast aside the
> truths that, in a Münzer, had the power to foreshadow a Marx, an
> Engels, a Lenin. These truths of doctrine and of life, which are today
> repudiated, are the class war and the extermination of the oppressor,
> the dictatorship of the party of the oppressed, the magnificent cycle
> that proceeds from faith (a stage that was not without its uses for
> two thousand years) to reason (a stage that was not without its uses
> over the last two centuries) and then to the class power that defeats
> the knowledge of the class of the modern tyrants, today's vampires,
> the bourgeoisie of commodity society.
>
> Greater than the faith of the Middle Ages and greater than the reason
> of the liberal revolutions, the dictatorship of the ignorant and the
> wretched must be victorious, which was so luminously erected in the
> time of Lenin, during the councils of the communist revolution.
>
> ...We have no particular preference for secularism as opposed to papal
> clericalism. We are only recording the minutes of the historical
> transition from faith to reason. But we desire, and we also foresee,
> the defeat of scientific reason, the abject simony of the capitalist
> form, and in this sinister atmosphere we cry out to the proletariat:
> neither Christian faith nor bourgeois science, but the dictatorship of
> your virgin and raw force, of your force that will someday liberate
> man from the dictatorship of all darkness.
>
> And there will be light[^6]."

> The workers will be victorious if they understand that they must not
> wait for anyone. Abiding in expectation of Messiahs and the cult of
> the genius, conceivable for Pierre and for Carlyle, are only, for
> Marxism in 1953, a miserable cover for impotence. The revolution will
> be terrible, but it will also be anonymous[^7].

Bordiga always seeks to be grounded in Marx and he always wants to prove
that Marx had the most correct approach to any particular question that
he was currently addressing. He only allows himself to contribute
improvements: with regard to the three examples of Chapter 27 of Volume
I of Capital, Bordiga thought that he was in fact able to find the
conclusion of that first book at the end of Chapter 32, with the famous
passage about the expropriation of the expropriators[^8], the rigorous
symbolic mathematics, in order to more accurately explain Marx's
work. He also always needs to praise the coherence of the theory, even
the coherence of what he called the Marxist school and which it would be
better to call the historic party.

The will to coherence sometimes works like inertia. The discourse closes
in on itself in order to restore its point of departure and to include
within it the different parts in such a way as to make them compatible
and not contradictory with the whole. The discourse is no longer open
and there is almost a fear of going astray. It was by way of this
hermeneutics, however, that he was capable of maintaining the
theoretical discourse.

The impetuous development of capital forced Bordiga to come to terms
with these positions. Beginning in 1957, after the discoveries of the
Grundrisse and the Manuscripts of 1844, and especially the preparatory
labors undertaken through the mediation of R. Dangeville (who also has
the great merit of having translated the Grundrisse into French, even if
the translation often leaves something to be desired), he postulated the
non-closed nature of Marx's discourse. These texts recently made
available contain themes that had not been addressed at all or had been
superficially addressed in the previously-known works of Marx. On the
other hand, the threat posed by capital in the epoch that produced the
launch of Sputnik, its will to resolve the difficulties of its
life-process in a realized indetermination by escaping the attraction of
the terrestrial globe and that of the human gravity that limits it, led
Bordiga to overcome his sometimes scientistic and overly-rigid
perspective on certain questions.

We have to apprehend this revolutionary, this party man, in his
connection with the future, since he lived in the future more than any
other person and nonetheless simultaneously was responsible for the
survival of a mystifying past that obscured this future.

> Marxism is precisely, in essence, a foreseeing of the
> future. Utopianism in the strict sense is not a foreseeing of the
> future, but rather a proposal to mold the future.

It is, by the way, in this latter work that he provides a masterful
demonstration of his claims regarding the foresight of the Russian
revolution.

> When the great Bolshevik revolution was victorious, most of the old
> comrades and neophytes -- the former perplexed, the latter inclined to
> enthusiasm -- did not hesitate to lift up their voices in praise,
> convinced as they were that the theoretical affirmations of the old
> Marx and the old Engels had been dealt a terrible setback.
>
> We were among the few who, amidst the glory of the victorious event
> that shook the foundations of the capitalist world, saw nothing more
> than the luminous confirmation of a complete and harmonious doctrine,
> the realization of a long and arduous, but temporary, period of

>

> of the inflexible line that, once found and accepted, cannot be
> transformed without also betraying it[^9].

Bordiga foresaw a very long wait for the coming revolution. In 1957, on
the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, in _7
novembre 1917-57: Quarante années d'une organique appréciation des
évènements de Russie dans le dramatique développement social et
historique international_, he predicted the onset of a revolutionary
phase in 1975. In 1958, he said:

> It is quite obvious that we are not on the threshold of the third
> world war, nor are we on the threshold of the great inter-war crisis,
> which will still take a few more years to develop, when the slogan of
> emulation and peace has revealed its economic content: one world
> market. Then, no State will be spared by the crisis.
>
> Today, there is only one conceivable victory for the working class:
> the doctrinal victory of Marxist economics over the commodity economy
> that is common to both the Americans and the Russians.
>
> In a second period, the task for the world Marxist party will consist
> in the victory of organization, in opposition to the demo-populist and
> demo-classist schemas.
>
> It is only in a third historical stage (which cannot take less than
> five years) when the question of class power will be on the table. In
> these three stages, the standard of measurement will be the shattering
> of equilibrium, first of all and above all -- if the imbeciles will
> allow us -- within the U.S. and within the U.S.S.R[^10].

This expresses both the power and the limitations of Bordiga's
theoretical thought. The limitations, because the development of the
revolution is still conceived according to the old perspective, and,
furthermore, the terminology displays a not very rigorous delimitation:
there is no Marxist economics (unfortunately, this expression is found
quite frequently in Bordiga, even in texts of great value like the
Elements of Marxist Economics), but only a critique of political
economy, a critique of capital. His power lies in having indicated the
determinant weak points of the world capitalist system and in having
discerned the essential tendency of capital: the formation of a world
market, although we must add that, at the present time, this tendency is
no longer displayed in a purely material form, but in the
hard-to-apprehend form of fictitious capital which is invested not only
in the western zone, but which is concentrating to an increasing degree
in the countries of the East and is tending to include China.

We referred to this prediction in our treatise distributed in May of
1968, _L'être humain est la véritable Gemeinwesen de l'homme_[^11], for
two reasons: (1) because 1968 opens up the new revolutionary stage, (2)
because, in a contradictory way, Bordiga has not recognized the
emergence of the revolution. His utter inability to perceive it is a
result of his own preconception about the development of the
reactivation of the revolution. It is above all the "second period"
which is marred the most by the old concepts: a vanguard is necessary
even if it is not referred to by this name. He therefore lost sight of
the fact that the party is the class that constitutes itself as a
party. The organizations which were intended to provide structure to
consciousness, to be its depositories, or even the defenders of a
restored theory, always end up being left behind, or else are
transformed into obstacles for the revolutionary movement.

We therefore employ that last quotation for the purpose of identifying
an element of continuity in the discontinuity created by May. Bordiga
was able to correctly delimit the fundamental points of the reactivation
of the revolution, and he should have been able to confront the moment
of its manifestation, but the weight of the past prevented him from
conceiving this moment of revolution in its new reality. The movement of
May was necessary to tell off the old fossils on the question of
organization and to reflect, even at the level of linguistic rigor, on
theoretical expression. In May 1968 the essential thing was the
emergence of communism, the anonymous manifestation of the revolution
despite all the recuperative agitation of the groupuscules that stood
outside the phenomenon, and this is the case even if this emergence
borrowed some inadequate discourses, due to the fact that it had not
purged itself of the old democratic beliefs. The explosion of May was
the affirmation of a total rejection of the society of capital and the
appeal to an affirmation of man, an impulse towards another type of
community. Thus, many of the affirmations-demands of May 1968 -- the end
of politics, the destruction of all separation, the rejection of the
militant-slave and martyr (we have no merit, as Bordiga often said) --
were present in the discourse of that uprising, but were based on an
outdated vision; the link between these affirmations of the future and
the praxis of the present was constructed by way of a now-superseded
schema of the revolution that reconnected with, by uncritically
glorifying them, all the factors of the revolution of 1917; hence its
immersion and its inefficacy, which allowed it to be rejected by the
epigones of the International Communist Party.

The important thing is this affirmation of the future, this refusal to
accept defeat, which could only be real because it was recognized as
such. This certainty with regard to the future springs from the
perception of the communist process of becoming of our society. The
future revolutionary act will simply make possible the full unfolding of
this process of becoming and will make it effective. Most
revolutionaries are only revolutionaries because of the revolution
itself, they are its immediate embodiment, or else they are perhaps the
personification of a discourse on the revolution. As a general rule, the
latter think of communism as something that is necessarily situated on
the other side of a particular moment: the revolution. Then what is
important for them is the latter, rather than communism. Communism only
provides a certain determination for the revolution that prevents it
from being confused with other kinds of revolutions.

For Bordiga, given that the revolution is the clash between two forms of
production, the capitalist mode of production and the communist mode of
production, it must be situated in relation to the totality of the new
social form.

It is not a matter of presenting the totality of the human being, social
man, if he ever was social, within the limits of what was possible in
the epoch in which he lived. The human being, that is, the man of the
party, a party whose program is communism. We merely want to present,
and to confront, the fundamental determination: his relation to
communism. Bordiga said and wrote concerning Marx and Engels that all of
their work consisted in a struggle for, and an impassioned description
of, communism. And he said this despite all the claims that Marx had
simply described capitalism in its liberal phase (the croaking of these
gentlemen!). This is the fundamental element, thanks to which Bordiga is
always current, always contemporary. This does not obviate the fact that
he also displayed other outdated aspects that pertained to all the
erroneous concerns of a historical epoch that is now in the past.

Here we see affirmed an invariable feature of Bordiga's thought,
anti-gradualism: the revolution is presented as a catastrophe for the
prevailing mode of production. This is accompanied by the rejection of
all concretism, which is in fact the trap into which those who believe
they can take historical shortcuts and thus avoid catastrophe fall.

During this whole period of his activity he was oriented towards the
formation of the party that would have to intervene directly in the
ongoing struggles, whether on behalf of the revolution in Italy, or to
support the Russian revolution. On this theoretical level, there is a
defense of the Russian revolution at the same time as an attempt to
define the contours of the movement in the west. The question of
communism is addressed indirectly, for example, on the occasion of the
critique of a book by Graziadei in L'Ordine Nuovo, Nos. 3-6, 1924: La
théorie de la plus-value de K. Marx, base vive et vitale du communisme.

The question of communism was also addressed with respect to the peasant
movement -- the agrarian question of 1921, where he confronts the
problem of the socialist transformation of agriculture. Here we find
very important considerations for this question, but it does not contain
an authentic description of communist society. He remains on the terrain
of general social relations, which are very important, but he does not
see all the transformations that affect men.

After the second world war Bordiga confronted the post-capitalist period
in more detail and tried to define communism more incisively.

> Leaping over a whole cycle, communism is the knowledge of a plan of
> life for the species. That is, for the human species[^14].

Here, Bordiga reaffirms another constant refrain in Marx and all those
who operate with the help of the theory Marx produced.

> Our formula is the abolition of wage labor; we have demonstrated that
> the formula of the abolition of private property in the means of
> production is a mere paraphrase...[^15].

> Socialism lies entirely in the negation of the capitalist enterprise,
> not in its conquest by the worker[^16].

After the polemic that opened up again within the International
Communist Party concerning the social nature of Russia and its
development, Bordiga was obliged to once again pick up the thread of the
succession of stages between capitalism and communism sketched by Marx
in the Critique of the Gotha Program. At that time, however, he also
engaged in a more far-reaching project: an attempt to take into
consideration the exceptional development of capital since the turn of
the 20th century.

The publication of Stalin's text, _Economic Problems of Socialism in the
USSR_, once again provided an occasion for a redefinition of the
different stages. There are no major differences with respect to the
resolutions of the meeting in Naples of September 1, 1951 (_"Leçons des
contre-révolutions, doubles révolutions -- nature capitaliste
révolutionnaire de l'économie russe"_, Thesis 45).

There is a certain absurdity in engaging in polemics with Stalin, as if
the latter, after the defeat of the revolution, had not acquired the
right to do whatever he wanted with the theory; only a victorious
struggle would have been able to reestablish it. It is true that
refuting Stalin might be useful for reaffirming the fundamental,
non-falsified factors of the theory. The refutation of Stalin is
therefore a chapter in Bordiga's hermeneutics; it was moreover necessary
to situate the necessity of mystification and its
characteristics. However, we cannot refrain from posing the following
question: how was it possible that a whole nation could have distorted
Marxist theory? And also, with respect to the West: is it possible that
what Marx had formulated in the 19th century could still be valid in
every point today? Isn't society much more mature today? These questions
were not posed.

Bordiga would later abandon this polemic. At the time, he intended to
use it as a positive affirmation, and as a recognition of the vacuum, of
the absence of any revolutionary movement, outside of the confines of a
few small groups. However, the polemic against other currents had
already fallen by the wayside for quite some time. This polemic was then
turned inward; hence the discourse converted into a dialogue in which
the author does not disclose the identity of his interlocutor. Down with
the cult of personality! Bordiga said that he was against polemics, but
to overcome them it was necessary to found something that, outside of
discontinuity, creates a field that the enemy could only enter with
difficulty, because it is occupied by communism; this is what he tried
to do and this contributed somewhat to an advance beyond the horizon of
his hermeneutics.

The internalized polemic was often the justification for its internal
employment. The left is not just a cultural movement, a study circle, it
does not reject action (cf. the position on the trade unions). This
basically refers to Damen, just as at the congress of Bologna, the
reference to Lenin, the question of tactics, etc.

Finally, he had to distinguish himself from the German-Dutch left, and
from the KAPD in particular. This is the reason for the commentaries and
the attacks that are incomprehensible for anyone who is unfamiliar with
all the vicissitudes of the Italian Left and Bordiga.

There is one point, however, where the polemic was not really
internalized, which provides a manifestation unclouded by any
justifications whatsoever; and that is when it deals with communism.

In his "Dialogue with the Dead" he does not retrace the study of the
post-capitalist stages. But it is from the moment of the publication of
this text that he places the highest priority on the following theorem:
one does not build socialism. Henceforth, it was no longer a matter of
refuting Stalin or his successors by responding negatively to the
question of whether or not socialism existed in the USSR, but of
destroying the very basis of this question. To build socialism is an
affirmation of a clear utopian style that irresistibly evokes the
various projects for the construction of the shining city. This implies
a pre-established plan, conceived and understood only by a handful of
leaders, or geniuses, etc. In reality, communism develops on the basis
of elements that already exist in the capitalist mode of production and
only the activity of the proletarians, by overthrowing capitalism, will
allow the process of becoming of communism to proceed to its
fulfillment. The party, for Bordiga, is a guiding force in this current;
it steers a process that it has not created and above all it is opposed
to any leadership that wants to divert the generous force of the
proletariat. It was in 1957, especially during the meeting in Paris --
whose resolutions were published under the title, _"Les fondements du
communisme révolutionnaire dans l'histoire de la lutte prolétarienne
internationale"_ -- and on the occasion of the study of the
Russian-Yugoslavian polemic, when this concept was enunciated by Bordiga
with even greater clarity. In the first text mentioned above, Bordiga
restated to a certain extent what he had always affirmed against the
idea that there are various paths to communism; we may discern echoes of
this in his articles from 1920 on the soviets, and in his writings
against the policy of founding revolutionary activity on the basis of
the enterprise (during the Bolshevization of the Communist
International). "The economic organizations of the enslaved proletariat
are crude substitutes for the revolutionary party":

> The beast is the enterprise, not the employer that the enterprise has
> at its head. How are we to reckon the economic equations between
> enterprises, especially when the big ones crush the small ones, how do
> we make these estimates between enterprises among which some have
> appropriated the yields of low productivity, while others have
> appropriated the yields of high productivity, or among those that use
> 'conventional' means of production and those that use nuclear energy?
> This system, erected like all its other features on a fetishism of
> equality and justice among individuals and on a disingenuous horror of
> privilege, of exploitation and of oppression, would be for them to the
> contrary a means of culture even more favorable than the usual civil
> society[^19].

The discovery of the Grundrisse and the Manuscripts of 1844 marked, as
we have already pointed out, an important moment in the work of
Bordiga. Even so, he did not really proceed beyond hermeneutics. He
refuted those who thought that the development of automation is a
practical refutation of Marx's theory of value. Bordiga did not,
however, extract all the logical consequences of the affirmation that
living labor time tends increasingly to decline in the capitalist mode
of production, that the activity of the worker is becoming almost
superfluous. He merely deduces from this postulate that value will have
been destroyed "doctrinally" before it is effectively destroyed in the
armed struggle of the future revolution. However, Marx's affirmations
that have currently encountered their verification in the most highly
developed zones of the world imply that it really is possible to destroy
value immediately. This also poses the question concerning the nature of
productive labor in today's society, the role of the proletariat in the
classic configuration, a modification of the post-capitalist stages such
as they were defined by Marx in the Critique of the Gotha Program for an
epoch in which the capitalist mode of production was far from having
reached its current level. Bordiga's demonstration falls far short of
being comprehensive in the sense that its purpose is to show that the
proletariat has no reason to reject his theory, Marxism, since the
latter has been absolutely verified. He did not concern himself
sufficiently with the total process of becoming of capital and of the
communism that is bound up with it.

More profound was the moment when Bordiga delimited the revolutionary
reformism of Marx which he had nonetheless evoked with respect to the
law regulating the length of the working day in the 19th century; a law
demanded by Marx and for which, he thought, the proletariat should have
fought bitterly, which it did. Defining the revolutionary reformism of
Marx entails also posing the question of the revolutionary reformism of
the proletariat. This reformism was valid as long as capital had not
completed its real domination. In effect, what this means is that
fighting for the reduction of the working day, and considering that
socialism is the dramatic diminution of the duration of the working day
even while capital is throwing workers onto the street or is creating
artificial jobs that do not create surplus value and that, ultimately,
do not even help to realize surplus value, are only necessary to
maintain labor as coercion. Capital has disintegrated the vital working
day of man. It is now a matter of restoring it outside of
capital. Furthermore, this determination of the working day only exists
because human activity must be measured; socialism is the destruction of
such measurement, while value, capital, cannot exist without it. This by
no means implies that we should insult the proletarians who are
demanding a reduction of the working day or an earlier retirement age,
which would amount to demanding that the contradiction of capital must
cease: its tendency of being unable to exist without men while at the
same time diminishing the labor time included in each
capital-commodity. Such a demand always involves aggression against
capital even if it can be increasingly absorbed in the latter's
reformism, which is restructuring the working week and finding different
ways to re-allocate labor among the different components of society. At
its origins, however, such a demand led to a reinforcement of the
unification of the class and compelled an augmentation of the productive
forces by stimulating the mechanism.

From now on it is obvious that one cannot consider the movement towards
socialism on the basis of the stages formulated by Marx. We must specify
how capital has in fact entered the stage of transition and, in a way,
the lower stage of socialism. In order to carry out this task, we must
obviously refer to the work of Marx, beginning with the Grundrisse and
Volume 3 of Capital.

Likewise, Bordiga was capable of more firmly grounding his opposition to
the world of the commodity, affirmed on various occasions in his
previous periods; for example, at the meeting in Naples in 1952, in
_"Caractères non mercantiles de la société socialiste"_, in which he
included a commentary, which he would have to revise several times, on
the chapter on the fetishist character of the commodity. This
characterization is repeated as a leitmotif in his articles on the
agrarian question, which were published in late 1953 and early 1954 in
Il Programma Comunista. Similarly, in 1963:

> With science, technology and labour, does man exploit nature? No, not
> at all, and the intelligent relationship between man and nature will
> arise when one stops making cost and design calculations in money, but
> in physical and human quantities.
>
> One can say exploiting when a human group exploits another. The

> violent manner. When the pay is good, risks to human life are normal
> fare for the society of money and wages.
>
> The whole valley ran the risk, and now it is dead[^20].

Here we must also note that it is not enough to say that man will
dominate nature when "the sinister social forces which enslave us more
than millions of cubic meters of tombstones"[^21] have been overthrown;
man will also be able to reconcile himself with nature as Marx affirmed
in 1844. The will to domination, the very expression of the despotism of
capital, has only led to the destruction of nature and the manipulation
of human nature, as Adorno has correctly pointed out.

Today everything is capital and, as a result, to speak of the world of
the commodity takes on the form of a concession to the past. One may
reply that Bordiga considered it as a fundamental aspect of capitalism
and not as a separate, autonomous entity. This is true, but in that case
his condemnation suffers from the fact that it operates only on the
level of negativity: the definition of communism as a non-commodity
society. However, in his commentaries on Marx's notes on Mill, Bordiga
goes beyond this negativity and rises to a vision of the
totality. Communism knows neither exchange nor the gift (our addition),
because the gift is nothing but a deferred exchange or at most an
initial moment of exchange.

Bordiga once again denounced production for the sake of production, the
slogan according to which socialism is immediately characterized by the
augmentation of the productive forces, the myth of production, of the
indefinite growth of the GDP (which has the consequence of exacerbating
the slavery of men); and he antithetically defined communism as the mode
of production in which "the goal of society is not production but
man". This inevitably led him to revisit his thesis that consumption
would become consumption for man and that, correlatively, the urgent
need to regenerate the species, to dis-intoxicate man, arises.

The condemnation of the society of capital required the study of the
previous modes of production; the revelation, after Marx, of their
superiority over our society imposed a new focus on primitive communism,
defined as natural communism, a mixture to some extent of myth and
social poetry. With these works, the strict boundaries within which we
had operated until then with Engels and his work _On the Origin of the
Family, Private Property and the State_, a framework in which African or
Asian societies could not find a place without shameless distortions of
reality. Engels does not deserve all the blame for this, for he did
state in his book that:

> Space does not allow us to consider the gentile institutions still
> existing in greater or lesser degree of purity among the most various
> savage and barbarian peoples, nor the traces of these institutions in
> the ancient history of the civilized peoples of Asia[^22].

At the same time, by pointing out the dispossession suffered by man over
the course of the development of class societies, Bordiga was led to
reconsider the link between modern and ancient science with other forms
of human knowledge, art and religion. His interest in myths was further
intensified, and he did not approach them from the reductionist
perspective of a stupid historical materialism, but as powerful
expressions of man's desire to recompose his community and to surpass
the limits imposed on him by the rise of class societies. As for the
myths that arose within societies without classes, they were the
testimonies of an elevated conception of the bond between man and
nature. An example is the myth of immortality. With the advent of
classes, man was reduced to an individual, an isolated particle, and he
suffers the full weight of this isolation-solitude; death appears as the
perfect realization of this solitude-separation; it must be fought by
way of the certainty of a beyond where the community is recreated, an
illusion that allowed it to maintain its continuity. For the man of the
society of the future, immortality is no longer situated in a state
beyond death, but within the life of the species, from which the
individual is not separated because social man is at the same time
_Gemeinwesen_.

Anti-democratism is reinforced by contact with the analysis of the works
of Bordiga's youth, but unfortunately he never carried out an exhaustive
study of the democratic phenomenon and, therefore, communism as the
negation of democracy was more asserted than proven. He also redefined
invariance as the permanence of the solution of the enigmas arrived at
by Marx in 1844, and he vigorously reaffirmed the reasons why the party
must be the anticipation of the future society. But the point we must
emphasize is the question of anti-individualism, or anti-personalism,
which assumed vast proportions, becoming the axis of his entire concept
of communism and the basis for his attitude towards previous periods.

Bordiga demonstrates that the individual exceptional-personality has no
determinative power. We have to apprehend the history of humanity not as
a product of the labors of individual geniuses, but as the work of
millions of men who have labored in obscurity for millennia. In the
final reckoning, only beings endowed with rare faculties can recognize
in themselves the immense process of becoming of millions of forces that
are crystallized within them at any given moment, and are thus capable
of becoming aware of how little they actually add to the ongoing labors
since the emergence of the species. This anti-individualism is the
affirmation of the species man, a species in the process of becoming,
not of a simple sum of individuals but of the syngameon that Bordiga
discusses in "The Factors of Race and Nation in Marxist Theory"
(1953)[^23]. This concept is elaborated on the basis of the perception
of the decisive and undeniable importance of mass action, the action of
the immense multitude of proletarians, during the course of
revolutions. With this he reaffirmed the existence of the millions of
beings who had worked or who are working on behalf of the
revolution. Bordiga did not boast of his own work but testified to that
of those others, at a time when the counterrevolution erased, and tended
to do so permanently, the vestiges of their struggles. In this sense he
was still a prophet.

Bordiga was right to denounce the passivity, or neutrality, of various
human molecules that,

> \[in\] a non-ionized historical environment ... are not oriented
> towards two antagonistic alignments. In those dead and repugnant
> periods, the person-molecule can situate itself in any

This is the best proof of the fact that it is capital that reduces men
to their status as molecules, that it leaves them bereft of the ability
to express themselves, without any capacity for reaction, full of their
own substance. Capital has taken their activity from men and given them
a wage and an ideology in exchange. The more men are dispossessed, the
stronger is capital. Capital, however, repudiates the
individualist-liberal theory and Bordiga's shortcoming is not to have
taken this into account: fascism was the negation of individuals with
the exaltation of a handful of necessary leaders, a kind of spectacular
general equivalent for the slave men of capital who must rule. This is
why it is impossible to simply postulate a negation of the individual,
because this negation is a possibility in the formation of a
totalitarian ideology that serves to maintain the despotism of capital,
and in a way sanctifies the loss of energy of all individuals who will
have to revolt against capital. The communist revolution, of course,
will pursue to its logical conclusion the negation of the individual
mentioned above, the negation of the person as being allegedly
determinant in historical processes, but this negation will not be for
the purpose of replacing this individual with the collective man who
already exists in the form of the collective worker, another modality of
the existence of capital, even though it is the basis of communism. If
one nullifies man by nullifying individuals, who will carry out the
revolution, in view of the fact that even in the party these
individual-men will still be so many nobodies? The party-entity, the
master alchemist capable of transforming a sum of zeroes into an
architect of the revolution!

The danger in Bordiga is that he maintains his thesis of the negation of
the individual right up to the advent of communism. By finally denying
man as a unit, communism appears henceforth to be solely the triumph of
the species.

In this grandiose construction, economic individualism is eliminated and
social man appears, whose limits are the same ones as those of human
society, or more accurately, of the human species.

Bordiga therefore interprets the social man of Marx as the species. More
evidence for this identification resides in the fact that, later in his
life, when specifying the content of the unitary human element, he would
speak of the social individual. This calls for two
clarifications. Individualism is an absolutely reprehensible theory and
it must be destroyed, but, as we saw above, it is capital itself that is
tending to do so. It is clear enough that it cannot be eliminated after
the disappearance of its normal basis, the individual, whether the real
nullity -- the proletarian -- a nullity inflated by the necessities of
capital -- or the great man of our times, who, in the eyes of capital's
own adepts, is increasingly taking on the appearance of an insignificant
clown. Bordiga's anti-individualism, however, is not accompanied by the
elimination of expressions like "the genius Marx", "the great Marx",
"the great Lenin", etc. It might be replied that such locutions had the
purpose of emphasizing the fact that great men, or great leaders, etc.,
cannot exist today. This is indisputable. In the early 1920s, Gorter
correctly pointed out that the more powerful the class becomes, the less
need it has for leaders. Yet this by no means implies that we must
produce theories that almost eulogize the insignificance of the men who
must compose the vast revolutionary movement that will overthrow
capital. Our task is necessarily entirely the contrary, without
nourishing any illusions, because only the revolution will effectively
provide men with the energy necessary to destroy the monster of
capital. And we shall add that, for Marx, social man is the man who
becomes the individual in the future communist society. We will finally
point out that to speak of a communist society is a concession to
immediate understanding; in fact, the human being will be the
Gemeinwesen (the community), which can still be apprehended immediately
by speaking of the human species, even if the latter is still an
all-too-zoological concept, and social man.

Social man will not exist in opposition to _Gemeinwesen_, since social
man will at the same time be _Gemeinwesen_, he will be at the same time
individual and universal; otherwise, no supersession will have taken
place, as we may clearly discern from Marx's notes on the works of Mill:

> Exchange, both of human activity within production itself and of human
> product against one another, is equivalent to species-activity and
> species-spirit, the real, conscious and true mode of existence of
> which is social activity and social enjoyment. Since human nature is
> the true community \[_Gemeinwesen_\] of men, by manifesting their
> nature men create, produce, the human community \[_Gemeinwesen_\], the
> social entity, which is no abstract universal power opposed to the
> single individual, but is the essential nature of each individual, his
> own activity, his own life, his own spirit, his own wealth. Hence this

> is a being estranged from himself.

Similarly, in the Manuscripts of 1844:

> Above all we must avoid postulating 'society' again as an abstraction
> vis-à-vis the individual. The individual is the social being. His
> manifestations of life -- even if they may not appear in the direct

> social existence, and as a totality of human manifestation of life.

Thus, social man (_Gemeinschaftlicher Mensch_) is at the same time an
individual and _Gemeinwesen_. If one translates this latter term by
"social being", it is then easy to identify it with social man and, in
this way, to avoid one of the essential determinations: the individual
determinateness. Bordiga's position is pregnant with regeneration from
the despotism of society, and therefore from capital made man.

Finally, this theoretical formulation has immediate consequences in the
concept of the party, since the latter is the anticipation of the
communist society. This concept leads Bordiga to attribute everything to
the party and nothing to its members, who not only do not exist except
by way of its mediation, but are interchangeable parts without any more
substance than that which is assigned to them by the party, or its
center, as the epigones would later say when they re-examined some of
Bordiga's observations. This led to an avian distemper that was all the
more stupid the greater the number of parrots that caught it. Such is
evidently the caricature to which this concept inevitably leads when it
has the opportunity to take shape.

You cannot fight against capital on its own ground, that of the
destruction of men. That is why the party can only be defined as that
which inaugurates a new community in which the members cannot be, and
this follows logically, social men, but beings with a profound need to
fight for the appropriation of human existence, realizable only after
the communist revolution, which makes effective the potentials of our
society.

This latter concept is an example of the insufficiency of a hermeneutic
that operates on the basis of the presupposition that the
characteristics of communist society, clearly determined and
antithetical to those of capital, are given by the rise of the class,
which is true from a general point of view but not with respect to
particular factors. It on the basis of the particular, however, that the
process of becoming which bears variations in its train is set in
motion. Thus, in the final phase of capital, which to a certain extent,
can be called decadent, capital imitates the society of the future and
realizes some of the immediate demands of the proletariat:
generalization of the proletarian condition, socialization of
production, introduction of economic planning, negation of the
individual, domination of nature, etc. In a way, under a mystified form,
there is a realization of the domination of the proletariat and of
certain measures of the lower stage of socialism. To affirm that this
mystification is simultaneously the destruction of men (capital can only
develop destructive forces) is not enough, since from its origin capital
destroys the two sources of wealth: nature and man. We must determine to
what extent capital has gone beyond its limits by becoming fictitious
capital and how this fictional quality has a repercussion on the process
of becoming and the action of the revolutionary class, that is, we must
precisely define its nature and redefine its immediate program.

Without going so far as to delimit this fictional quality of capital,
Bordiga did, however, address this task; this is why his works are full
of starting points for new research, which were never brought to further
development because they were inhibited by the organizational inertia of
the International Communist Party, whose existence manifested the
ambiguity of the position and works of Bordiga himself.

It is this task that, for us, is essential, as well as the description
of all the revolutions that have convulsed humanity and have served to
prepare for the one that must finally come from this long and dolorous
wait, which is now largely experienced.

Some people will have a tendency to classify the work of Bordiga among
the manifestations of absolute dogmatism, in the sectarian schema,
thinking that he definitively denied the process of becoming, by
proclaiming that he had undervalued the dialectic, etc., all because
they will not have understood a fundamental point: if there is an
"invariance of Marxism" it is not because the latter, as a theory of the
proletariat, like communism, a truth born in the 19th century, is always
valid, in such a way that society would be the same as it was in 1848
(since then it was only a matter, to make it triumph, of resorting to an
adequate agitation thanks to a solid organization), but because it is an
anticipation. Communism appears not only as the solution of the
proletariat-capital antagonism that existed in the 19th century, but
also of the antagonism that is presented, with new determinations,
between the proletariat and capital in the 20th century, because the
theory contains the foresight of the whole course of historical
development of capital and of the modalities according to which the
maturation of social relations had to facilitate the process of becoming
of communism. Marx expressed the generic solution and exposed the phases
that human society would have to pass through in order to realize
communism. And this is valid not just for the works of Marx, but also
for the works of the proletarian class itself, for, by way of its
struggle, its assault on heaven, its radical revolution, it anticipated
the solution by externalizing it.

For Bordiga, the revolution as art is intuition; that is why it does not
abide by compromises, but is instead a lightning assault that must
transform everything to attain its goal; without this, there is no
anticipation. In counterrevolutionary periods of reflux, the task is to
maintain the level of anticipation. Hence the revolutionary proposition
(because it demolishes the old perspective), "Marxism is a theory of the
counterrevolution", since it is a matter of maintaining the line of the
future when the whole social development in process denies it in an
immediate way. On the other hand, when there is no longer any action,
only reflexive and intensive thought can reencounter that which the
activity of the masses had been able to discover after its generous
impulse. Correspondingly, the possibility then arose that, as a result,
thinkers would take themselves for inventors, for the authors of the
discoveries brought to light by the multitude of men in struggle against
the enemy class, the established order. At the moment when the exploited
class destroys the enemy class, it creates the field upon which it will
be able to manifest the new vision, the understanding of the new social
organism. The anticipation implies the destruction of everything that
stands in its way. The theory allows, in the periods of reaction, the
maintenance of revolutionary continuity to the extent that it maintains
the potential to negate the field of historical-social inhibition.

This is what explains the apparent contradiction of the behavior of
Bordiga when he affirms the primacy of theory and exalts at the same
time the activity of uneducated, frustrated and ignorant men, the
proletarians, the representatives of non-culture, the only persons who
are capable of carrying out the revolution. Unfortunately, he did not
sufficiently take into account the fact that in the prolonged absence of
a revolutionary movement, theory itself can be negated, both directly
and indirectly, by way of the introduction of all kinds of concepts that
are alien to it, or because it is paralyzed and reduced to a
stereotype. On the other hand, we must point out that
communism-theory-anticipation, without theory, can appear as a magical
affirmation. Furthermore, within this anticipation, there are moments
that have now been realized, and irreversibly rendered obsolete. Bordiga
explained one of them: the use of democracy. Now the revolutionary
movement in process moves in the realized, and realizing
anticipation. We must therefore resume the profound theoretical work to
delimit, on the basis of this point, the process of becoming of the real
movement and anticipate its future.

The counterrevolution works by destroying the revolutionary forces
represented by the associations of men, by parties; then it implements,
from above, gradually, in a mystified form, the demands of those
associations; when its task is completed and the revolution inevitably
recedes, it can only retard the revolutionary process by submerging the
new revolutionaries in the rediscovered discourse of the previous
era. Thus, these new revolutionaries, instead of applying themselves to
the task of understanding reality, believe they are more revolutionary
because they rehabilitate the themes and slogans of their ancestors from
fifty years before. Revolutionaries with the eyes of antiquarians can
only see in the present-day movement the struggles of the past. It is
the moment of the flourishing of the various returns to the diverse
currents of the period of the early 1920s, as we currently
observe. There can be no doubt that there will also be an intensive
return to Bordiga due to his description of communism; but a mere return
would miss the point, since Bordiga cannot give a global, adequate view;
he lived in the moment of the passage of capital from its formal
domination to its real domination, and he was acquainted with the
revolutionary movements that developed over the course of this
transformation. This marked him with certain limitations: the
impossibility of irrevocably cutting his ties with the past (the Third
International and its sequels), the inability to correctly delimit the
process of becoming of the new revolutionary movement, not recognizing
its first manifestations in May 1968. Not to take this into account
would be to betray Bordiga's passion as well as ours, which must attain
its object: communism.
