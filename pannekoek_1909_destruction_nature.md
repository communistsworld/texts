There are numerous complaints in the scientific literature about
the increasing destruction of forests. But it is not only the joy
that every nature-lover feels for forests that should be taken into
account. There are also important material interests, indeed the vital
interests of humanity. With the disappearance of abundant forests,
countries known in Antiquity for their fertility, which were densely
populated and famous as granaries for the great cities, have become
stony deserts. Rain seldom falls there except as devastating diluvian
downpours that carry away the layers of humus which the rain should
fertilise. Where the mountain forests have been destroyed, torrents
fed by summer rains cause enormous masses of stones and sand to
roll down, which clog up Alpine valleys, clearing away forests and
devastating villages whose inhabitants are innocent, "due to the fact
that personal interest and ignorance have destroyed the forest and
headwaters in the high valley".

The authors strongly insist on personal interest and ignorance in
their eloquent description of this miserable situation but they do
not look into its causes. They probably think that emphasising the
consequences is enough to replace ignorance by a better understanding
and to undo the effects. They do not see that this is only a part
of the phenomenon, one of numerous similar effects that capitalism,
this mode of production which is the highest stage of profit-hunting,
has on nature.

Why is France a country poor in forests which has to import every year
hundreds of millions of francs worth of wood from abroad and spend much
more to repair through reforestation the disastrous consequences of
the deforestation of the Alps? Under the Ancien Regime there were many
state forests. But the bourgeoisie, who took the helm of the French
Revolution, saw in these only an instrument for private enrichment.
Speculators cleared 3 million hectares to change wood into gold. They
did not think of the future, only of the immediate profit.

For capitalism all natural resources are nothing but gold. The more
quickly it exploits them, the more the flow of gold accelerates. The
private economy results in each individual trying to make the most
profit possible without even thinking for a single moment of the
general interest, that of humanity. As a result, every wild animal
having a monetary value and every wild plant giving rise to profit
is immediately the object of a race to extermination. The elephants
of Africa have almost disappeared, victims of systematic hunting
for their ivory. It is similar for rubber trees, which are the
victim of a predatory economy in which everyone only destroys them
without planting new ones. In Siberia, it has been noted that furred
animals are becoming rarer due to intensive hunting and that the
most valuable species could soon disappear. In Canada, vast virgin
forests have been reduced to cinders, not only by settlers who want
to cultivate the soil, but also by "prospectors" looking for mineral
deposits who transform mountain slopes into bare rock so as to have a
better overview of the ground. In New Guinea, a massacre of birds of
paradise was organised to satisfy the expensive whim of an American
woman billionaire. Fashion craziness, typical of a capitalism wasting
surplus value, has already led to the extermination of rare species;
sea birds on the east coast of America only owe their survival to the
strict intervention of the state. Such examples could be multiplied
at will.

But are not plants and animals there to be used by humans for their
own purposes? Here, we completely leave aside the question of the
preservation of nature as it would be without human intervention. We
know that humans are the masters of the Earth and that they completely
transform nature to meet their needs. To live, we are completely
dependent on the forces of nature and on natural resources; we have
to use and consume them. That is not the question here, only the way
capitalism makes use of them.

A rational social order will have to use the available natural
resources in such a way that what is consumed is replaced at the
same time, so that society does not impoverish itself and can become
wealthier. A closed economy which consumes part of its seed corn
impoverishes itself more and more and must inevitably fail. But that
is the way capitalism acts. This is an economy which does not think
of the future but lives only in the immediate present. In today's
economic order, nature does not serve humanity, but capital. It is
not the clothing, food or cultural needs of humanity that govern
production, but capital's appetite for profit, for gold.

Natural resources are exploited as if reserves were infinite
and inexhaustible. The harmful consequences of deforestation for
agriculture and the destruction of useful animals and plants expose
the finite character of available reserves and the failure of this
type of economy. Roosevelt recognises this failure when he wants to
call an international conference to review the state of still available
natural resources and to take measures to stop them being wasted.

Of course the plan itself is humbug. The state could do much to stop
the pitiless extermination of rare species. But the capitalist state
is in the end a poor representative of the good of humanity. It must
halt in face of the essential interests of capital.

Capitalism is a headless economy which cannot regulate its acts by
an understanding of their consequences. But its devastating character
does not derive from this fact alone. Over the centuries humans have
also exploited nature in a foolish way, without thinking of the future
of humanity as a whole. But their power was limited. Nature was so
vast and so powerful that with their feeble technical means humans
could only exceptionally damage it. Capitalism, by contrast, has
replaced local needs with world needs, and created modern techniques
for exploiting nature. So it is now a question of enormous masses of
matter being subjected to colossal means of destruction and removed
by powerful means of transportation. Society under capitalism can be
compared to a gigantic unintelligent body; while capitalism develops
its power without limit, it is at the same time senselessly devastating
more and more the environment from which it lives. Only socialism,
which can give this body consciousness and reasoned action, will at
the same time replace the devastation of nature by a rational economy.
